The strongest tie between the US and China is unraveling. For decades, Wall Street and corporate America have chased the promise of the ascendant Chinese consumer. As regular Chinese households got richer, there was money to be made selling them everything from fried chicken to Fendi. US companies like Starbucks, Apple, and Nike jumped in to gobble up market share. Sure, there were some boycotts and busts, but the trend line for returns was up and to the right. And as long as the Chinese consumer's glorious rise was as inevitable as the Chinese Communist Party claimed, gains would multiply. That was the story. It was gospel. But now it's falling apart. The once-flowering Chinese consumer is languishing. US companies are losing market share to China-based rivals. Beset by political and economic forces, American brands can no longer count on China for growth. That changes the risk calculus. Why invest heavily in a market that's boxing you out? Without the promise of profits, American firms are also becoming less willing to go to bat for China — to reinforce the idea that China's market is crucial to the success of their futures. Beijing is finding itself increasingly friendless in Washington — and the weight of the US-China relationship is shifting from constructing mutually beneficial economic ties to balancing antagonistic national security interests. Rather than try to resurrect the Chinese consumer and, by extension, reestablish critical economic ties with America, though, its leader, Xi Jinping, doesn't seem to care. Advertisement "Xi doesn't wake up every day, look at the economy, and panic," Lee Miller, the founder of the survey firm China Beige Book told me. "He thinks they're doing what they need to do, and it's painful medicine." What China needs to do, in Xi's mind, is make itself indestructible and indispensable. That means supporting state-owned enterprises and other domestic firms, giving them a leg up in the market as they compete against foreign firms for a piece of China's shrinking economic pie. It means getting the rest of the world addicted to China's products — not just cheap manufactured goods but also advanced technology like semiconductors , batteries , and AI and the commodities that make up the downstream of its supply chain, such as gallium and germanium. Self-sufficiency for me, but not for thee. It is a strategy so imbalanced that it dares the rest of the world to do something about it. And it does not include Chinese people getting hooked on frappuccinos made by an American company. Part of the peace between China and the US has been the notion that we can do business with one another even though we don't share the same values. The US strives to be an open society; China is increasingly closed. We may butt heads in the South China Sea, over Taiwan, over resources across the globe, but it was money that kept us together. Without access to the Chinese consumer, US stakeholders have less reason to see China as a market and more reason to see it as a menace. No demand After pandemic lockdowns ended in 2023, the Chinese economy experienced what is known on Wall Street as a "dead cat bounce." Picture a dead cat being dropped: It may rebound off the ground a bit, but after that, it's going nowhere. Similarly, China's decimated economy got a bit of a pickup once COVID restrictions ended in 2023, but a year later, things look bleak. Beijing's 5% GDP growth target — once seen as a slam dunk — is now openly in doubt. Debt in the property market is still dragging the economy down, and the government's bets on an export boom don't seem to be paying off. Prolonged deflation erodes the value of China's currency and ultimately means it has to sell more exports to make the same amount of money. Unemployment for Chinese young people between the ages of 16 and 24 spiked to 17.1% in July, forcing a new class of (often) overeducated graduates to compete for low-wage jobs. They're being called "rotten tail kids." Brutal. Advertisement In previous downturns, the Chinese Communist Party reacted by shooting the money gun — spending on infrastructure, housing, and keeping people employed. This kept the wheels turning, but each turn left the country with a larger pile of debt. There is only one way to get off a ride like this, and it's a painful period of paying down debt that can obliterate demand in an economy. Xi has decided to put down the money gun without doing anything to aid average Chinese households as the economy shrinks. Xi told party members in July to show "unwavering faith" in his grand economic strategy, but he has paid them in dust. Earlier this month, in an unusual divergence from Xi's policy, the former head of the People's Bank of China, Yi Gang, said that the government should engage in some kind of stimulus to reach its already-softened growth targets. The inflation that does exist in the economy, as the Carnegie Endowment fellow Michael Pettis noted , is being driven by higher food prices due to shortages — hardly a sign that things could be turning around. What money Chinese consumers are still able to spend is increasingly going to companies that grew up in their home country. American companies have been feeling this burn. At the beginning of this year, China's Apple iPhone sales fell 24% , and they've been trending down ever since. Starbucks, which has more than 7,300 stores in China, saw comparable store sales — revenue generated by a retail location relative to its performance in the past — fall 14% in the second quarter. Nike's China woes have contributed to its year-to-date nearly 30% stock slump. F oreign car companies are getting crushed, too . Tesla — yes, even Tesla — saw its share of the Chinese electric-vehicle market decline from 9% to 6.5% in the first seven months of the year. In response to the reports, CEO Elon Musk said: "Believing the news is silly. Our Shanghai factory is running at max capacity." In other words: not no. In a recent US-China Business Council member survey , China's economic growth came in as American companies' second-biggest concern about the country — a "real constraint that was somewhat unthinkable only a few years ago." The council said that a quarter of its members cited "insufficient demand or overcapacity as the No. 1 constraint on profitability this year." Related stories What money Chinese consumers are still able to spend is increasingly going to companies that grew up in their home country. Domestic Chinese phone makers are eating Apple's lunch, with Huawei's smartphone sales surging 70% in the first three months of the year. Starbucks opened its first China store in 1999 and used to be seen as a status symbol , but now it has stiffer competition from Chinese brands like Luckin and Cotti Coffee. This is no accident; it's part of Xi's plan to rid China of foreign dependence and influence. In the US-China Business Council survey , 80% of respondents said that "China's industrial policies are strengthening companies that were previously uncompetitive," and competition from Chinese rivals came in as the third-highest concern about doing business there. Yes, US companies are still making money in China. But it's increasingly uncomfortable , and the Magic 8 Ball says the outlook is not good. Ya gotta have friends (in Washington) America's elite financial firms will still publicly tell you they expect to keep investing in China even though the investment-banking business in the country has, as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said, "fallen off a cliff ." Behind closed doors, however, Wall Street power players are singing a much different tune. It's not just the pressure from the economy — it's also the political climate. It's hard to do business in a country where data and people keep disappearing. Wall Street's change of attitude is reflected in the flow of money into China: Foreign direct investment is at a 30-year low, and from June to (as best we can tell) early August, investors pulled $12 billion from China's stock market. This could make 2024 China's first year of equity outflows. But we won't know for sure because, given the equity dumping, China decided last month to stop publishing data showing net investment flows from foreign funds into mainland stocks. Advertisement The declining Sino-Wall Street links are of particular note, not because I think the people of Shanghai and Beijing will miss drinking Moutai with Goldman Sachs bankers but because Wall Street is a powerful ally in Washington. They arrange meetings between stakeholders and talk up the benefits of the cross-Pacific relationship. Once upon a time, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the biggest hedge fund in the world, would tell anyone — global politicians, investors, anyone who read one of his many books or blog posts — about China's bright future. Now he's telling everyone he's minimizing his exposure to the country and that there will be no "beautiful deleveraging" for China. This is the last thing Beijing needs seeping into the minds of US policymakers. One former East Asia State Department official told me China is sending CCP delegations to DC like mad, but no one will meet with them. Without allies, Washington is a lonely (or hostile) place for foreign governments, especially when those foreign governments have crafted an economic strategy that can potentially disadvantage our economy. "We're heading into another trade war no matter who is president," Miller told me. "The economic model Xi wants is not compatible with the rest of the world. The mindset is to look at it from a national security perspective rather than an economic perspective." Related stories There are distinctions between what a President Kamala Harris and a President Donald Trump would mean for that trade war, though. Harris' camp would pursue a more incremental strategy, targeted toward protecting industries tied to tech and national security, and more in concert with our allies — a group the CCP has begun pejoratively calling "US-West." It's an attempt to paint the US as dragging its allies along with our trade policies kicking and screaming. Trump would create more chaos and disunity between the US and its allies, which serves Beijing in the trade wars. However, he'll likely surround himself with China advisors who are much more aggressive and have a wider array of opinions on how to attack the Chinese economy — a bull in a china shop strategy, if you will. For Beijing, the problem is that this fractious group will be more likely to trip over its red line: Taiwan — and Trump lacks the attention span and temperament to stop them. The CCP has a plan for how to deal with a trade war, a kinetic war over Taiwan is much more worrisome for them and the entire planet. Putting national security, rather than economic cooperation, at the center of the US-China relationship centers it in a space where the two great economic powers are antagonistic. White House aside, Beijing has a blind spot here. The former State Department official told me that CCP officials don't fully understand the amount of power Congress wields. And Congress has become stridently anti-China. Even the Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee — once willing to let Wall Street invest freely in the Chinese economy — cannot agree about how stringent to make limitations on investing there. Some want to go hard; others want to go harder. The bipartisan House Select Committee on China has no problem firing warning shots at some of China's last corporate allies, the semiconductor companies. China's own attempts to develop a domestic-chip supply chain still lag behind the state of the art, so it needs US companies like Broadcom and Nvidia. Those companies, in turn, love the billions they make in China. But in a series of tweets , the Select Committee urged the Biden administration to ignore semiconductor lobbyists working in Washington. Advertisement "We urge the Biden Administration to maintain the strong export controls put in place in October 2022," it said. "Weakening these measures would raise serious concerns about safeguarding U.S. technological leadership and our national security." "If these [semiconductor] CEOs believe that current US export control policy is bad for the US economy and our national security," it continued, "then they must make that case publicly, perhaps before a congressional committee." Miller told me that a tech decoupling between the US and China isn't a problem for Congress anymore — it's a goal. "A lot of this is talking to US companies who have a big share in China and are saying, 'You can't do this to us,'" he said. "Well, guess what? There are tradeoffs. Right now, we're not paying a high enough price for the right policy." The price of this shift cannot be quantified in corporate profits. It cannot be quantified in dollars at all. Cordell Hull, the US Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944 and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, once said , "Unhampered trade dovetailed with peace; high tariffs, trade barriers, and unfair competition with war." Putting national security, rather than economic cooperation, at the center of the US-China relationship centers it in a space where the two great economic powers are antagonistic. It gives corporations, already under financial pressure as China's economy declines, even less reason to act as interlocutors encouraging stability between Washington and Beijing. It leaves us living in a more precarious world. Linette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Business Insider.

Stocks Gain as Traders Weigh Another Big Rate Cut: Markets Wrap Read full article Cristin Flanagan Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 9:07 PM 6 min read Link Copied 17 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- US equities eked out a gain as traders parsed commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers and saw scope for further easing after last week’s half a percentage point interest-rate cut. Most Read from Bloomberg Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport The S&P 500 advanced 0.3%, a whisker away from last week’s all-time high as Fed officials reflected on the central bank’s policy path. In a sign that the market’s gains may be broadening out, an equal-weighted version of the benchmark — that gives Bath & Body Works Inc. the same sway as Nvidia Corp. — rose 0.5% to close at a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed at a record while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3%. Among individual movers, shares of Intel Corp. climbed 3.3% after Apollo Global Management Inc. was said to have offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in the chipmaker. Boeing Co. advanced some 2% after offering sweetened deal terms to striking workers. Data showing US business activity is robust even as growth moderates stoked confidence the world’s largest economy can nail a soft landing. US business activity expanded at a slightly slower pace in early September, according to data released Monday, while expectations deteriorated and a gauge of prices received climbed to a six-month high. “This is a somewhat inconclusive report, and therefore it shouldn’t alter Fed expectations dramatically,” according to Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “The flash PMIs do suggest the US economy is on reasonably sound footing, especially compared to Europe.” Traders have been wagering on nearly three-quarters of a point of policy easing by year end, suggesting at least one more jumbo rate cut is in store. Wall Street and policymakers alike are awaiting jobs data for more clues on the direction of the economy. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said with inflation approaching the central bank’s target the focus should turn to the labor market and “that likely means many more rate cuts over the next year.” Neel Kashkari at the Minneapolis Fed also pointed to weakness in the job market, he backs lowering interest rates by another half percentage point by year end. His counterpart at the Atlanta Fed, Raphael Bostic took a moderate stance. Starting the central bank’s cutting cycle with a large step would help bring interest rates closer to neutral levels, but officials should not commit to a cadence of outsize moves, according to Bostic. Story continues Later this week, investors will get data on the Fed’s preferred price metric and data on US personal spending, due on Friday. Yields on the policy-sensitive US two-year fell to 3.58% while longer dated Treasuries were little changed. US government bonds had been under pressure with the Treasury slated to auction $183 billion in front-end supply and up to $25 billion of new issuance in corporates expected this week. “With the Fed’s first rate cut since 2020 in the history books, many investors may be thinking, ‘Now what?’,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That will keep the spotlight on economic growth, especially the jobs market.” Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni had a warning for central bankers, saying last week’s aggressive rate cut could cause inflation to resurface if central bankers don’t tread carefully. The Fed is ignoring the upcoming presidential election where both candidates are proposing policies that could trigger inflation, he added. In Europe, the euro slumped while European stocks notched small gains after weak PMI data for France and Germany was followed by numbers that showed the euro-area’s private-sector economy shrank for the first time since March. The common currency weakened as much as 0.7% against the dollar amid wagers on more aggressive rate cuts from the European Central Bank. “The market is almost demanding a more aggressive rate cut, especially after what we have seen the Fed has done,” Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street, said on Bloomberg Television. The ECB “is definitely behind the curve,” she said. Corporate Highlights: Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that would be a vote of confidence in the chipmaker’s turnaround strategy. Boeing Co. offered its largest union a 30% wage hike in a bid to break a stalemate that has shut down its aircraft manufacturing across the Pacific Northwest. Brookfield Asset Management has raised an initial $2.4 billion for a fund dedicated to investing in clean energy and transition assets in emerging markets, about halfway to its goal. Palantir Technologies Inc.’s co-founder and chief executive officer Alex Karp, has a love-hate relationship with Wall Street. He’s said that analysts don’t understand the company and that he prefers Palantir’s loyal army of retail investors. StandardAero Inc. is seeking to raise $1.1 billion in its initial public offering, after its backer Carlyle Group Inc. had decided to pursue a listing for the aircraft maintenance services provider rather than a sale. Elsewhere, Asian markets were lifted by speculation China is close to announcing fresh stimulus, after a cut to a short-term policy rate and a rare economic briefing scheduled for Tuesday. Gold reached another record high as the worsening strife in the Middle East fueled wagers on further price gains in the metal due to its haven status. US oil and gas stocks outperformed.

Intel explores $5 billion investment offer from Apollo amid market decline | TechSpot Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . In a nutshell: It seems that beleaguered Intel has finally received some good news. According to reports, US asset management company Apollo Global Management has offered to invest up to $5 billion into Team Blue, which was recently rumored to be an acquisition target for Qualcomm. Apollo has indicated in recent days that it would be willing to make an equity-like investment of up to $5 billion in Intel, reports Bloomberg , citing one of the people familiar with the matter. Intel's executives are said to be weighing the proposal, adding that talks regarding the deal are in the early stages and may not lead anywhere. The size of Apollo's investment could change, too. Apollo Global Headquarters Increasing the likelihood of Apollo's investment is its previous relationship with Intel. The firm said earlier this year that it would acquire a 49% equity interest in a joint venture that controls Intel's new manufacturing plant in Ireland for $11 billion. The news comes at a tumultuous time for Intel. Once the world's most valuable chip manufacturer, its market cap has crashed from $290 billion in 2020 to $93.19 billion today, while the share price has lost 50% of its value this year alone. // Related Stories Intel Arrow Lake-S CPU gets delidded ahead of launch, showcasing tiled architecture OpenAI's Sam Altman dismissed as "podcasting bro" by TSMC over $7 trillion proposal Intel's share price over the last five years Intel has implemented a cost-reduction plan that will see more than 15% of its employees laid off before the end of the year, while operational expenses are being cut by more than $10 billion. It is also splitting its struggling foundry division into an independent subsidiary. Last weekend saw reports that rival tech giant Qualcomm had made a takeover offer for Intel, with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon personally involved in the negotiations. Such a deal could represent the largest tech acquisition ever, though it would undoubtedly face the scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Intel's shares have recovered slightly this month, rising from $18.89 on September 6 to $21.84 today.

Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 3:31 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Lululemon Athletica fair value estimate is US$315 Current share price of US$263 suggests Lululemon Athletica is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for LULU is US$316 which is similar to our fair value estimate Does the September share price for Lululemon Athletica Inc. ( NASDAQ:LULU ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Lululemon Athletica Step By Step Through The Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.37b US$1.53b US$1.50b US$1.92b US$1.98b US$2.03b US$2.09b US$2.14b US$2.20b US$2.25b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 2.68% Est @ 2.62% Est @ 2.59% Est @ 2.56% Est @ 2.54% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.2k US$1.5k US$1.4k US$1.4k US$1.3k US$1.2k US$1.2k US$1.1k ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.5%) = US$51b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$51b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%) 10 = US$26b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$39b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$263, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf Important Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lululemon Athletica as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.101. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Lululemon Athletica Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Currently debt free. Weakness No major weaknesses identified for LULU. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Significant insider buying over the past 3 months. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Moving On: Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , YouTube , and Bloomberg . All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here . ~~~ 00:00:09 [Speaker Changed] This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio 00:00:15 [Speaker Changed] This week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Victor sla, founder, CIO of the $19 billion Strategic Value Partners. Victor has had a fascinating career, stood up the distressed debt department at Citibank before doing the same thing at Merrill Lynch a few years later. He also spent time at Sebus and More Capital before launching his own firm in 2001. They do everything from hard assets like real estate, infrastructure, aircraft, power plants, to private debt, event driven opportunities. Europe accounts for anywhere between a third and a half of their investments. They have a number of businesses that they’ve taken over through the debt side of the equation. 15 businesses with over 90,000 employees. Really just a fascinating person who has seen the distressed debt business from day one. He was there at the creation and has taken it to all sorts of really interesting places. I found this conversation to be absolutely fascinating if you’re at all interested in things like hard debt and what distressed asset buying is like, and what it’s like to take over a company, not through its equity, but through its defaulted debt. I, I think you’ll find this to be an absolutely fascinating conversation. I know I did. With no further ado, my discussion with Strategic Value Partners, Victor Kla. Victor Kla, welcome to Bloomberg. 00:01:56 [Speaker Changed] Thank you. Thanks for having me, Bob. 00:01:57 [Speaker Changed] So, so I skimmed over a lot of your, your cv We’ll, we’ll get to some more details in a little while. Let’s just start with your educational background. Bachelor of Commerce with honors from Delhi University, a Master’s in Economic from Vanderbilt, and then an MBA from the University of Chicago. So, is it, is it safe to say finance was always in the career plans? Oh, 00:02:22 [Speaker Changed] Gosh, yes. 00:02:23 [Speaker Changed] From, from the beginning. 00:02:24 [Speaker Changed] Finance and business was always in the career plans. Running a $19 billion private equity, opportunistic credit firm was not. Right. It isn’t like that was the plan 40 years ago. You, 00:02:40 [Speaker Changed] You, you just tack into what was working and continue to build on it. Talk a little bit about your professional experience, ’cause I find it absolutely fascinating. You are relatively young in your career when you’re at Citibank, or was it Citigroup then? I, I keep track. And you essentially created their distressed debt department. Te tell us about that experience. What was that, 25, 30 years ago? Maybe more. 00:03:07 [Speaker Changed] It was more, it was 30 years 00:03:10 [Speaker Changed] Ago, 1980s, late 00:03:12 [Speaker Changed] Eighties, early nineties. Right. When, when it happened. Yes. I worked in all the places Barry, you described, right, right. The two places. I think what’s really interesting is I was there at the beginning at the creation of a loan trading business. 00:03:30 [Speaker Changed] Like it did not exist at Citi or most of Wall Street. It, it did before the early nineties. 00:03:35 [Speaker Changed] It did not exist. This is totally novel exist. Bloomingdale’s filed for bankruptcy, S-C-I-T-V filed for bankruptcy, and for the first time banks, which owned the debt, wanted to sell. So 00:03:50 [Speaker Changed] They’re sitting on, they’re sitting on a lot of bad paper. Yeah. And they don’t really know what it’s worth. They don’t know what to do with it. How do they come to you and Citi and say, Hey, we’re stuck with all this paper and you know, we’d like to at least have a partial recovery. 00:04:05 [Speaker Changed] That was what really got it going. There was no price. You had to kind of analyze it to come up with a price. And at the same time, there were very few buyers, more and more sellers. So the pricing was really good where you could buy these loans. Right. 00:04:24 [Speaker Changed] So, so was Citi acting as a middleman looking for buyers of distressed debt? Or did someone like yourself have the insight and say, Hey, you know, at a hundred cents on the dollar, this is junk. But at 15, 20 cents, there’s some upside. 00:04:39 [Speaker Changed] At Citi and at Merrill, I ran a proprietary trading business. And proprietary trading is using the firm capital to kind of buy it and also to distribute it, to syndicated it more broadly at the same time. But, but I think if I was to go back through my career, that moment in time, you know, when there is this big wave coming, because it was the start of the high yield market, the leverage loan market grew dramatically, you know, from 200 billion in the mid nineties to $5 trillion today, high yield and leverage loans. Right. And these deals, which never used to trade in the secondary market, they started to change hands. I was there right at the beginning of that big wave. And, and what has happened to me career wise is just riding that wave as it got bigger, as it got more complicated as it became us and Europe, not just us, as it went from buying and selling distressed debt to going out and taking control of businesses, operating them and improving them. It was all set at that moment of time in the early nineties. 00:06:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s, let’s just stay in the early nineties at Citi for a few minutes. At the time, you’re early in your career, you have some experience, and an MBA when, when you first started hearing that from banks that, Hey, we got all this Bloomingdale debt. Tell us what went through your mind? Did you envision, oh, you know, there’s a market for here and there’s an opportunity. How, how did you look at this and then how did you stand up? That whole distressed debt department at city 00:06:31 [Speaker Changed] Banks are wanting to sell? I have worked at Booz Allen and Hamilton, I’m a strategic planning guy. I get hired by Citibank in planning. I work for a really senior guy in the investment bank. This business is just starting. I write a business plan for it. 00:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Like a legitimate, like it, like it’s a freestanding entity. Like, 00:06:56 [Speaker Changed] Like, you know, it’s a business. We should be like, 00:06:58 [Speaker Changed] It’s 00:06:58 [Speaker Changed] A startup. Yes. It’s a business we should be bigger in. We should grow in. And, and there were a couple of people inside Citibank who were pioneers in trying to buy and sell loans. Right? I get folded right into that group after writing the business plan. And boy, we are off to the races now. You know, when you look at something like a Bloomingdale’s, what you have to ask yourself is, Bloomingdale’s is restructuring. It’s going through a bankruptcy, right? It’s got the debt itself, which banks want to sell. You have to price it. And at this point in time, the bankruptcy processes, the restructuring processes weren’t that well developed, right? You had to really say, Hey, it’s a two year stint in bankruptcy, right? We are going to cut costs. We’ll make this business much more efficient right. As we do it. And then you say, what is the business worth? Right? 00:07:57 [Speaker Changed] And I, and at the time, they had a good name. Yeah. A good brand, fantastic real estate locations. So there was some assets that were salvageable. The question was, do we continue as a going concern or do we just liquidate? You guys just said, Hey, let’s, let’s reorganize this. ’cause there’s still value here. It’s not, we’re not just gonna sell it off for parts 00:08:20 [Speaker Changed] E Exactly. Right. And by the way, most of the businesses we invest in, there’s much more value, even like today, there’s much more value in fixing it, in transforming it than selling it for pots. But because these are really good businesses, which got levered, they got leveraged through these leverage buyouts. Right? But that valuation, to be able to come up with the valuation, to be then able to work in a restructuring process, bankruptcy process, and say, Hey, I think at the end of this, we are buying debt at 50 cents. It could be worth 80, 90 cents. It could take two to four years to kind of get there. That’s how this business started. Huh? It was just not well understood. Even the fact that there was a bankruptcy process, which could be two years long or three years long. Right. It was just not well understood in the early nineties. 00:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So I have so many questions for you about, ’cause this is such a, the nineties was such a fascinating era. So first, was this like a small side project at Citi? Or did the higher ups say, oh, Victor’s onto something, let’s put some capital into this and see where it goes. What were, what was the initial reaction within Citi? 00:09:44 [Speaker Changed] And by the way, don’t get me wrong, please. It wasn’t just Victor. I know it wasn’t just Victor. I 00:09:49 [Speaker Changed] Was a, it’s the, you know, anytime we talk about Merrill or City or UBS or Morgan, we’re always talking about big teams Yes. With a number of different people leading different departments. Yeah. All that said, you wrote the, the business plan. So, so how, how, how warmly was it embraced? Or was it, all right, give the kid a couple of bucks and let’s see how far this goes. 00:10:09 [Speaker Changed] It, it started out with give the kids a couple of bucks, right? And then what happened was, like, literally in the first few weeks, 00:10:19 [Speaker Changed] So not long at all, like immediate success, 00:10:22 [Speaker Changed] Boom, right there, we are starting to get in the middle of some of these secondary sales of debt. It’s almost like liftoff, right? Because the moment in time, you, you know, in those days, Barry, a lot of debt was owned by Japanese banks. And I recall European banks, right? 00:10:41 [Speaker Changed] Remember when everyone was terrified they were gonna buy Rockefeller Center and they’re gonna take over? Yeah. Everything around the late eighties, early nineties, that was peak Japan. Yeah. And they spent the next 30 years wandering in the desert. 00:10:53 [Speaker Changed] Well, they’ve had a tough few decades. Right? 00:10:56 [Speaker Changed] Right. Although they seem to be very much on the, on the comeback. But so immediately this looks successful. 00:11:01 [Speaker Changed] Typically 30% of the market was owned by Japanese banks. Really? 00:11:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s a giant number 00:11:08 [Speaker Changed] In the early nineties. Right? Wow. So now you have these restructurings, you have these bankruptcies, and the Japanese banks want to sell the debt. They drive it, then the European banks want to sell, because US bankruptcy in those days was not as well understood. Right. And then, boy, it, it was almost like bankruptcy filings boom, debt for sale, boom, boom. Wow. And it just took 00:11:35 [Speaker Changed] Off. And, and my recollection is that when foreign banks come into the US and buy up a bunch of assets or debt or whatever it is, and when they start to run into trouble back home, there’s usually a change of leadership. Hmm. And whoever the new owner of the foreign banks are, tend to say, Hey, I didn’t buy that junk. You guys just get rid of this. Whatever you can get for it, hit the bid. They’re very aggressive sellers. Or am I, am I misremembering this? 00:12:05 [Speaker Changed] They, they are, they are aggressive sellers and foreign banks, foreign institutions tend to be more aggressive. But there’s also a very, you know, there’s also a very economic reason for it, right? Because when you are in a restructuring, the debt you own has defaulted, right? And the central bank, which governs you, like the one in Japan, or like the one in the United States, right? They make you take reserves, mark it down, right? 00:12:34 [Speaker Changed] So you write it down to zero. So whatever you get for it is practically found money. You’ve already taken the hit. 00:12:40 [Speaker Changed] So there’s a very good economic reason why all you know, short, they’re far away, right? They don’t quite understand what’s going on. 00:12:49 [Speaker Changed] It’s a small part of their book. Right? Yeah. 00:12:51 [Speaker Changed] No. So the obvious reason, right? But then also the economic reason that, hey, I have it marked down. I have all these non-performing loans in my balance sheet. It’s creating a drag the way equity analysts look at my balance sheet. I should be selling, I should be getting out. Right? So, and by the way, it con continues to today, if you have a bankruptcy filing, you have a restructuring, right? They, they will sell the debt, they’ll sell it at a price, which is probably too low. But there’s a very sound economic reason for the banks or the CLOs to want to sell. 00:13:30 [Speaker Changed] They have a very different set of priorities than a pure distress debt buyer. Right? 00:13:35 [Speaker Changed] Exactly right. Huh. But Barry, can I tell you, but go back, go back to one thought though. I wanted to make sure it just came through. Early

Yardeni Says Fed Cut Raises Odds of ‘Outright Melt-Up’ in Stocks Read full article Yardeni Says Fed Cut Raises Odds of ‘Outright Melt-Up’ in Stocks · Bloomberg Alexandra Semenova Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 6:15 PM 3 min read Link Copied 12 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- US stocks can soar to fresh highs thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive half-point interest rate cut last week, but it also could cause inflation to resurface if central bankers don’t tread carefully, according to Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni. Most Read from Bloomberg Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport The latest policy decision lifted the odds of an “outright melt-up” in equity prices — like during the dot-com bubble when the S&P 500 Index roared 220% from 1995 to the end of the century — to 30% from 20%. He placed the chances of a bull market at 80%, while reserving a 20% probability for a 1970s-like scenario, when stock markets around the world were gripped by volatility due to inflation and geopolitical tensions. But there’s a broader risk if things start running too hot. “If they overheat the economy and create a bubble in the stock market, they’re creating some issues,” the founder of eponymous firm Yardeni Research Inc. said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Monday. He added that the Fed is ignoring the upcoming US presidential election, in which both candidates are proposing policies that could trigger inflation. The remarks come as policymakers reiterate confidence in their decision to deliver an outsized cut to kick off the easing cycle. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Monday said he supported the half-point reduction but that he expects smaller quarter-point moves at the November and December meetings. Meanwhile, his Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said last week’s large move will help bring interest rates closer to neutral levels as the risks of managing inflation and employment become more balanced. Stocks had a tough start to the month, with the S&P 500 Index dropping more than 4% in the first week. But since then, investor confidence that officials can engineer a soft landing has grown, putting the broad equities benchmark on pace for its best September — historically the index’s worst month of the year — since 2019. Yardeni again leaned into his idea that markets are in a new “Roaring ’20s” period, marked by productivity, growth and substantial equity returns. However, he said his odds of such a scenario fell to 50% from 60% previously. The soothsayer, typically among the most bullish forecasters on Wall Street, has an S&P 500 target of 5,800, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of strategists. That once eye-popping forecast now looks in line with many of his optimistic peers, who’ve steadily lifted their outlooks to keep up with the S&P 500’s 20% rally this year. Story continues BMO Capital Markets has the highest call for the US stock benchmark at 6,100, while Evercore ISI sees the gauge closing at 6,000 by year end. On the other end of the spectrum, Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., warned last week that the market is in a dot-com-bubble “Groundhog Day,” and said stocks could plunge by up to 13% by the fourth quarter.

Big UK investors poised to buy the dip in US property Read full article FILE PHOTO: The logo of Legal & General insurance company is seen at their office in central London · Reuters Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 7:11 AM 2 min read Link Copied 2 In this article: By Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise LONDON (Reuters) - British investment managers Legal & General and Schroders are to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in commercial property in the United States, but are largely steering clear of the hard-hit office sector, the companies told Reuters. The fund managers, which oversee more than 1.9 trillion pounds ($2.5 trillion) of assets between them, said they had separately been building up their U.S. real estate teams to make the push, anticipating that property prices will recover, aided by falling interest rates. Legal & General CEO António Simões told Reuters that U.S. real estate was a key expansion market for the company, adding that the market's fundamentals remained strong. Higher borrowing costs and widespread adoption of home working post-pandemic have hit property prices globally, with the U.S. office market hit particularly hard and investors still nervous about oversupply. But expectations of more interest rate cuts after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a bumper 50 basis points reduction last week have improved the investment outlook. Property analysts also said the U.S. market tends to reset faster than continental Europe, with lenders and developers quicker to reprice assets. L&G plans to expand its fledgling U.S. real estate equity portfolio by hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years, while adding a similar level of exposure in its more established real estate debt business, the company said. The fund manager has built a team of around 20 people in Chicago to help with the equity investment push, with a focus on rental homes across the country that have fared better than offices. Schroders said it was aiming to grow its own nascent U.S. real estate equity portfolio from tens of millions of dollars currently, to hundreds of millions over the medium term. The firm this month made an investment in a pan-American data centre portfolio, one of its initial forays. "We see the beginning of the Fed journey to normal interest rates as a key to unlock some pent-up demand," said Michelle Russell-Dowe, co-head of private debt and credit alternatives at Schroders Capital, the London-listed manager's private markets arm. Schroders has also identified opportunities in real estate debt, as banks retreat due to tougher capital rules. "The scale of the opportunity is huge," said Jeffrey Williams, a New York-based investor at Schroders. "There's a big gap in financing that other lenders are going to have to fill." The company said it was not averse to office investments, but they would need to be high quality developments. Story continues British insurer Phoenix's fund arm, which manages around 290 billion pounds, told Reuters it also planned to "invest considerably" in U.S. real estate but declined to give details on the scale of potential investment.

An Intrinsic Calculation For BP Plastics Holding Bhd. (KLSE:BPPLAS) Suggests It's 37% Undervalued Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 1:10 AM 6 min read Link Copied 0 Key Insights The projected fair value for BP Plastics Holding Bhd is RM2.07 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity BP Plastics Holding Bhd's RM1.30 share price signals that it might be 37% undervalued Analyst price target for BPPLAS is RM1.54 which is 26% below our fair value estimate Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of BP Plastics Holding Bhd. ( KLSE:BPPLAS ) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for BP Plastics Holding Bhd What's The Estimated Valuation? We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (MYR, Millions) RM27.1m RM29.2m RM29.4m RM29.7m RM30.3m RM31.1m RM32.0m RM32.9m RM34.0m RM35.1m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 0.41% Est @ 1.35% Est @ 2.01% Est @ 2.47% Est @ 2.80% Est @ 3.02% Est @ 3.18% Est @ 3.29% Present Value (MYR, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% RM25.1 RM25.1 RM23.3 RM21.9 RM20.6 RM19.6 RM18.6 RM17.8 RM17.0 RM16.2 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM205m After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = RM35m× (1 + 3.6%) ÷ (8.0%– 3.6%) = RM814m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = RM814m÷ ( 1 + 8.0%) 10 = RM377m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM582m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of RM1.3, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at BP Plastics Holding Bhd as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Eastern & Oriental Berhad's (KLSE:E&O) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 6:40 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 Eastern & Oriental Berhad's (KLSE:E&O) stock is up by a considerable 11% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Eastern & Oriental Berhad's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Eastern & Oriental Berhad How To Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Eastern & Oriental Berhad is: 6.6% = RM145m ÷ RM2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every MYR1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated MYR0.07 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Eastern & Oriental Berhad's Earnings Growth And 6.6% ROE On the face of it, Eastern & Oriental Berhad's ROE is not much to talk about. However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 4.4%, is definitely interesting. Even more so after seeing Eastern & Oriental Berhad's exceptional 48% net income growth over the past five years. That being said, the company does have a slightly low ROE to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average. So, there might well be other reasons for the earnings to grow. For example, it is possible that the broader industry is going through a high growth phase, or that the company has a low payout ratio. As a next step, we compared Eastern & Oriental Berhad's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 13%. Story continues past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Eastern & Oriental Berhad fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Is Eastern & Oriental Berhad Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Given that Eastern & Oriental Berhad doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business. Conclusion On the whole, we feel that Eastern & Oriental Berhad's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

The city's electricity rates have been between 16-20% higher than the national average in recent years, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics , and residents are increasingly looking to save money and go green by installing solar panels. "Philadelphia is perfect for solar," said Liz Robinson, executive director of the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association , a local educational nonprofit. "The southeastern corner of Pennsylvania has the highest insolation, which means the highest number of solar days, compared to the rest of the state." Solar panels are a good fit for Philadelphia for other reasons, too. The city is built on a north-south rectilinear grid, an ideal orientation for catching rays. Many neighborhoods have minimal tree cover, and flat roofs on the city's many row houses make installation easier. Robinson notes that because electricity rates tend to be higher there than elsewhere in Pennsylvania, residents can save more on their electric bills. Can solar panels save you money? Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we’ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings. "When you install solar panels here in Philly, you're getting a little faster payback than you would if you were in another part of the state," she said.

Best national solar panel companies in Philadelphia Here's a look at the best solar installers among national companies that operate in Philadelphia. Tesla Solar Most affordable Read full review Tesla's solar branch seems to be the least loved of Elon Musk's ventures. Even Tesla's Solar Roof seems to get more love. If price is the thing you won't budge on, consider Tesla. By all accounts, Tesla installs quality panels and makes the closest thing there is to a household name in solar storage: the Powerwall. Where you might miss out is customer service. Discussion online seems to suggest Tesla's service is a bit of a gamble. Equipment 7.3 / 10 Warranty 6.5 / 10 Service 8 / 10 . . . Start Savings Estimate Pros and Cons Pros Low prices and a price-match guarantee Quality equipment Lower-profile panels Cons Anecdotally, customer service can be poor Fewer equipment options Areas served All 50 states Product details Solar panels from Tesla are likely to be the cheapest option where they are available. You can save thousands of dollars, without sacrificing on quality of equipment or the warranties that protect it. What you might sacrifice is customer service. From delays to price changes, to slow responses, to system malfunctions, social media reports of negative experiences aren't hard to find, including some who regret their choice. This is true of all solar companies, but the quantity of reports concerning Tesla is concerning. Show more details Palmetto Solar Best overall Read full review Solar panels are typically low maintenance equipment, but they're also unfamiliar. If you want to reap the benefits of solar but will have a bit more peace of mind if someone else is making sure it's working, Palmetto might be a good fit for you. Just remember to add the cost of Palmetto's monitoring service in to your payback period calculations. Equipment 9.3 / 10 Warranty 6 / 10 Service 10 / 10 . . .

Freedom Forever also extends a couple of products that take some of the pain and risk out of going solar, like a production guarantee and an escrow option with cash purchases. Online reviews say customer satisfaction has been low of late, though the company says that's changing. Equipment 9.3 / 10 Warranty 7 / 10 Service 5 / 10 . . . Start Savings Estimate Pros and Cons Pros Production guarantee Price-match guarantee Cash escrow option Cons Customer service concerns Some warranties are longer elsewhere Areas served Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington D.C., Wisconsin Product details Freedom Forever, one of the largest American solar installers, installs some of the most popular residential equipment.

Freedom Forever has had customer service issues, with complaints of paying for a nonfunctional system while dealing with poor communication and long waits.

The company says things have turned around after a bad stretch, but it’s worth monitoring. Show more details Momentum Solar All in-house installers Read full review Momentum installs in 11 states without using subcontractors. While using in-house installers doesn't guarantee a better experience, it does suggest you're likely to get a more uniform experience from Momentum. The fact that Momentum backs its installations with a 25-year workmanship warranty hints at a strong belief in its crews' ability. If Momentum is part of your search, consider the warranties against leaks that other companies offer. Momentum's is five years, which isn't the best. Equipment 6 / 10 Warranty 7.5 / 10 Service 7 / 10 . . . Start Savings Estimate Pros and Cons Pros 25-year warranty on workmanship and equipment Doesn't use subcontractors Long track record in the industry Cons Only offers one brand of panels 5-year roof penetration warranty Areas served Only solar panels: Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nevada, Pennsylvania Also installs batteries: California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Texas Product details Momentum Solar puts Qcells solar panels on roofs in 11 states, and installs Enphase batteries alongside them in five of those.

Show more details Local solar panel installers in Philadelphia Solar States This NABCEP-certified B Corp is one of Philadelphia's longest-running solar installers, operating since 2008 in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. The company has a dual mission of installing residential and commercial solar while also providing solar industry education and career opportunities to Philly residents. Solar States is a member of the Solar Energy Industries Association and a member of solar cooperative Amicus, which vets equipment suppliers and helps member companies get discounted pricing. See at Solar-states Evoke Solar Evoke Solar is another longtime installer in the Philly area, with 13 years of service in the region. This full-service solar design company is NABCEP-certified and operates in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Evoke is one of the few companies in Pennsylvania that installs SunPower panels, which come with a 25-year warranty. Installs typically include a five-year warranty on workmanship. See at Evokesolar How to determine which solar company is best for me In addition to reading online reviews and checking the Better Business Bureau to vet solar installers in Philadelphia, you'll want to check that companies are certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). Robinson also recommends asking friends and neighbors who have gone solar for referrals to a dependable installer. "Look for a company with staying power," she said. "Because the system lasts so long, and you will have to replace your inverter at some point, you want a contractor who's highly experienced and is going to be there in 10 or 15 years." Cost of solar panels in Philadelphia The cost of solar panels in Philadelphia depends on several factors, including the size of the system and labor costs. Equipment, including the panels and inverters—which can account for as much as 50% of the price tag—can also make an installation more or less expensive. Factors like electricity rates and incentives like net metering or selling SRECs can also affect your payback period. Getty Images Installing a solar battery along with your system will drive up the cost significantly; these can add anywhere from $12,000 to $22,000 to the total. You'll also want to get your roof in good shape before installation, so you may need to factor in repairs or replacement. Other costs, like permitting, racking, site surveying and maintenance, also contribute to the final cost. In Pennsylvania, the average cost to install solar panels is around $28,400 before incentives, with an average price per watt of $3.55—less than the national average. However, that total cost can be reduced by 30% with tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act , plus other potential incentives. Related costs like roof repair or replacement and solar batteries can be bundled into that 30% credit. Philadelphia solar panel installation cost Typical system size (kW) Price per watt Total installed cost (before incentives) Total cost after 30% federal tax credit Philadelphia/Pennsylvania 8 $3.55 $28,400 $19,880 National average 6.67 $3.67 $31,558 $22,091 Philadelphia solar panel incentives and rebates Federal, state and city incentives can make going solar in Philadelphia more affordable. Plus, there's another long-term perk: Installing solar panels has been shown to increase your home's property values by a national average of 4.1%, according to a study by real estate listing site Zillow. Philadelphians can also take advantage of Solarize Philly , a project of the Philadelphia Energy Authority that has helped 3,300 households install solar since 2010. Residents can access pre-negotiated discounts with vetted solar installers participating in the program. Another perk of Solarize Philly, Robinson said, is that the program will manage the process of connecting your system to PECO, the local electric utility. Solarize is currently only available to city residents, but Inflation Reduction Act funding has allowed the program to expand into the entire five-county region. Robinson estimated that Solarize Greater Philadelphia will be available to Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties sometime in 2025. Philadelphia residential solar incentives Program Description Federal residential clean energy credit This incentive gives homeowners who install solar panels a tax credit of 30% of the total cost of the project. Net metering Pennsylvania's state-governed net metering policy entitles Philadelphia residents who go solar with the full retail price of the power they sell back to the electric utility as a bill credit. State-level tax credit No Solar Alternative Energy Certificates (SAECs) Pennsylvania residents can earn one SAEC, the state's equivalent to an SREC, for every megawatt generated by their system, then sell those credits on the state's open market. Philadelphia Solar Rebate This city program, which provided a rebate of $0.20 per watt for residential solar projects, is currently closed due to budget cuts related to COVID-19. However, Philadelphia residents who installed solar on or after July 1, 2019, can apply for the waiting list and may be eligible for the rebate in the event that funding is restored. Community solar No Sales tax exemption No Property tax exemption No Installation factors to keep in mind Before you install solar in Philadelphia, consider these factors that can affect the cost, payback period, and efficacy of your panels. Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection has also compiled resources for homeowners considering solar that can help you think through the process. Your roof: The orientation and condition of your roof are a big factor in deciding whether solar panels are worth it. Robinson noted that in some areas of Philadelphia, especially lower-income neighborhoods, roofs may have more than the two recommended layers of material, which presents a safety issue when racking and panels are installed. She also recommends white-coating your roof before installation to protect and add longevity to the material and help keep your home cool. A reputable installer can assess your roof and help you make this decision. Tree cover and other shade: While many Philly neighborhoods have relatively little tree cover, neighboring buildings or shade can significantly affect the performance of your panels. In particularly leafy neighborhoods such as Mt. Airy and Chestnut Hill, homes may not be a good fit for solar. Philadelphia state peak sun hours: Compared to the rest of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia receives more sun. The state of Pennsylvania receives between 3.6 and 4.1 peak sun hours each day on average; experts recommend that your home receive at least four peak sun hours per day for solar panel installation to be worth it. HOA regulations: Consider any HOA regulations that might affect your ability to install solar. Pennsylvania does not have solar access laws or legislation that prevents HOAs from banning solar panels for residents. Homeowner's insurance: Installing solar panels may have an effect on your homeowner's insurance premiums or on your policy's coverage limits. Renting vs. owning: The cost and permanence of solar makes installing panels practical for homeowners, not renters. Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles, has more than 11,000 solar panels. Does the stadium's solar capacity top the NFL? Philadelphia Eagles How to pay for solar panels in Philadelphia Though they'll save you money in the long run, solar panels can be a big upfront investment. It's important to understand the pros and cons of each payment method, including how factors like interest or fees could affect your payback period. You'll also want to think about when and how to pay for solar in relation to your current electricity bills. Cash If you've got it, cash is the best way to pay for your solar panels. Your payback period won't be extended by high interest rates or fees on a loan, and you'll start saving money on your electric bill right away. If you don't have $15,000 to $30,000 lying around, you can make the most of higher savings interest rates with a high-yield savings account , certificate of deposit, money market account or even US Treasury I-Bonds to grow your nest egg for a future install. Solar loan Many solar installation companies offer solar loans or work with third-party

Advertisement The Cheng family is one of Hong Kong's most prominent and richest families, owning billions in property and a bustling jewelry business that's a household name in Asia. Bloomberg estimated their net worth to be $22.7 billion in March, though it's since fallen to $17.7 billion in September. The family's company, New World Development, oversees about 41.5 million square feet of property — more than all of Central Park — in Hong Kong, Asia's most expensive city for real estate. The Cheng clan revolves around the families of two brothers, though the elder and his children have long been considered the main force in the business. Advertisement As he nears 80, the family patriarch is expected to name a successor. But he's been coy so far with his plans, and rumors of a possible family feud abound in Hong Kong. The suspense turned into turmoil on Thursday, when his eldest son, assumed for years to be the one to take over, announced his resignation as CEO just after the company announced its first loss in decades. Here's what you need to know about the Chengs, a family whose massive wealth is rooted in the city's early days: Advertisement The Chengs' wealth comes from their grandfather, a jeweler turned real-estate mogul. Cheng Yu-tung, center, ran a property empire birthed from the profits of his jewelry business. Jonathan Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Image The Chengs' empire can be traced back to World War II, when their grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung, started working as an apprentice at a gold shop in Macau called Chow Tai Fook. In 1943, he married the daughter of the shop's owner, and shortly after, he moved to Hong Kong to open the store's first branch. As the Asian financial hub's affluence accelerated after the war, so did Cheng's business, which specialized in 24-karat gold jewelry. The jeweler invested his profits heavily in real estate during the 1970s, starting a company called New World Development. Now publicly listed, it owns department stores, hotels, and infrastructure across mainland China, Hong Kong, and the US. Cheng died in 2016 at the age of 91, when he was worth about $14.6 billion. His elder son, Henry, took over the jewelry and real-estate empire. With the 77-year-old Henry now signaling that he may be looking for a successor, his two eldest children, Adrian and Sonia, have entered the spotlight. Each has been running a key pillar of the family's property business for more than a decade, so they're considered the de facto contenders for their father's position. Both oversaw meaningful expansions in their primary fields — hotels for Sonia and commercial real estate for Adrian — and have worked to transform their properties into cultural icons for younger generations. Advertisement Sonia runs the family's hotel business, turning it into a sprawling collection of resorts and luxury locations. Sonia Cheng, left, is the head of the Rosewood Hotel Group, which owns 51 hotels and is planning more than two dozen others. The group includes the Carlyle in New York City. Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images for The Business of Fashion and Thomas Iannaccone/Penske Media via Getty Image Sonia, 43, studied applied math at Harvard University before working as a real-estate banker for Morgan Stanley and in private equity for Warburg Pincus, according to a 2019 profile by CNBC . In 2008, she joined her family's business at age 28, becoming CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group three years later when the Chengs purchased the properties from Rosewood Corp. and Maritz, Wolff & Co . The luxury hotel brand owned 19 properties at the time, including the glamorous Carlyle hotel in Manhattan, which celebrities flock to when they visit for the Met Gala. With Sonia at the helm, Rosewood has since expanded into a global powerhouse for luxury hotels, with 34 locations and another 24 on the way. It's pushed hard into mainland China under the brand name New World Hotels, opening 16 more properties in cities such as Beijing, Sanya, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, for a total of 51 hotels and resorts. Sonia has often said she grew up in the hotel industry since her father, Henry, started his career as general manager of a hotel. She told the Singaporean outlet Channel News Asia that her philosophy had been to ditch stuffy hotel standards and attract younger travelers looking for tailor-made experiences. "There's a sense of discovery and curiosity when we go to hotels, we don't want to go to a place that doesn't reflect the local culture," she said. Rosewood's Hong Kong property ranked second on the World's 50 Best Hotels' 2023 list , with two other hotels in São Paulo and Paris earning spots as well. Sonia is married to Paulo Pong Kin-yee, who also comes from one of Hong Kong's wealthiest families, the Pongs . He's the founder of Altaya Group, a wine wholesaler, and the boutique restaurant company Classified Group, which runs five locations. Advertisement Adrian, the eldest sibling, helms his brand of billion-dollar megamalls that double as art museums. Adrian Cheng, pictured in the center at an event last year, launched K11's art malls in 2008. Keith Tsuji/Getty Images for K11 Adrian, 44, was long presumed to succeed his father as head of the family's wealth. The eldest of four siblings, he started his career as a banker at UBS and Goldman Sachs before diving into the family business in 2007. A year later, Adrian launched K11, his brand of malls and office buildings in Hong Kong and China that came with a unique selling point — a focus on showcasing art and designer work. Art has been core to his personal brand. A classical singer who trained on Broadway, he graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's in East Asian Studies. He's perhaps best known for K11 Musea, a $2.6 billion mall on Hong Kong's Victoria Dockside that has some 40 art installations and hosted Asia's first-ever Cannes Film Festival Week in 2019 . Adrian himself maintains a long list of personal art ventures, such as organizing a Louis Vuitton menswear fashion show in November and paying to save an iconic 1,300-seat cinema that opened in 1952. Seen for years as the heir apparent to the Cheng business empire, he's dominated the lion's share of headlines about the family. Like his sister, he led aggressive expansions for New World Development, pouring billions into residential and commercial buildings in Hong Kong and Chinese urban hubs. His vision is to bring K11 to nine Chinese cities in total, and he's now building a mall in Shenzhen that's estimated to cost $1.4 billion . A prolific investor, he's put money into more than 60 companies through his fund, C Ventures, including Shein, electric-vehicle makers such as XPeng, and the COVID-19 detection tech startup Prenetics. C Ventures declared assets of more than $700 million when it merged with a Swiss investment firm in July. Adrian is married to Jennifer Yu, who runs Chow Tai Fook Education, a collection of K-12 schools and play facilities, and Arch Education, a tutoring company. Advertisement Their father, Henry, hinted at a succession toss-up at a time when Adrian was expected to be heir. Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development, at a 2016 press conference on the company's financials. Jonathan Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Images In November, Adrian and Sonia's father turned heads in a television interview when he made a cryptic remark about his successor . "I'm still observing, but I think it's not so easy to identify such a person," Henry said, adding that if there was no one suitable, the Chengs could "hire from the outside." Each family member could continue to helm their own sector of the business, Henry said. That comment rattled what had for years been presumed by the business world as the plan for the Chengs — that Adrian would take over everything. By then, the family's net worth had reached $26 billion, and Adrian was already CEO of New World Development, though his father still controlled the family's assets. Bloomberg noted that Adrian's representatives had described him in 2020 as "the heir to New World Development and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises." Henry raised further uncertainty in December about his family's succession when Adrian and Sonia's younger brother Brian was placed in a top role in the company's construction and infrastructure arm . All three were poised to lead their own fiefdoms in the Cheng empire, with Henry's fourth child, Christopher, holding an executive directorship at the company. Their cousin and the vice-chairman of Chow Tai Fook, Conroy, denied in a November earnings press conference that there was any family infighting. But on Thursday, it became clear that the Chengs' traditional succession narrative had been thrown into disarray. Adrian announced that he would step down as CEO and become a non-executive director in the company. He would focus instead on public services, he told reporters at a press conference. Advertisement The Chengs have been beset by bleak market conditions as Hong Kong tries to regain its footing. The entrance of the K11 Art Mall in Hong Kong. NurPhoto/Getty Images The Chengs have had to weather an ailing property market in Hong Kong. The city suffered a rout among investors and residents after recent years of political turmoil, coupled with a weaker economy after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower demand for property from mainland China's wealthy buyers. Rising taxes and interest rates in the city have also slowed the market, hemming in New World Development after it gobbled up loans and new properties. The company's stock has dropped about 82% in the past five years. Adrian's resignation also comes as New World Development suffered a heavy blow under his leadership — its first annual loss in 20 years. In late August, the company reported that it expected to post a loss of up to $2.6 billion for the 2023 financial year, which ended in June. It was a sign of heavy pressure on the company, which is already considered one of Hong Kong's most indebted property developers. The Financial Times reported shortly after the announcement, citing several unnamed sources familiar with the company, that New World Development staff were growing worried about how quickly the Chengs were expanding. "Today we face one of the most challenging combinations seen in decades — from high interest rates to uncertain market conditions," Adrian said in a statement to the FT. "I believe this game of patience paired with consistency and dedication will eventually get us to our goals." He's been attempting to shore up confidence in Hong Kong's status as a financial hub, having started an institute in November to promote the city to the wealthy . "I'm very confident we will be No. 1 for family office wealth management in the future," he told Bloomberg in August. As Adrian exited the company's executive leadership on Thursday, New World Development's chief operating officer, Ma Siu-Cheung, became CEO. A representative for New World Development declined to comment for this story. September 27, 2024: This story was updated to reflect Adrian Cheng's resignation as CEO.

Advertisement Once a Silicon Valley leader, Intel has been a staple of the computer-chip-making business for decades. In the past several years, it has fallen from grace, failing to jump on the AI train in time. For decades, Intel led in chip design and manufacturing. A series of missed opportunities over the years has contributed to its current financial challenges. When The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Qualcomm had approached Intel for a takeover, tech forums were abuzz — and for good reason. A rescue for Intel is bound up with debates about the US's shifting role in the world's chip industry and the battle for dominance in the era of accelerated computing. Advertisement Intel has been trying to correct its course for years. In 2021, it brought back Pat Gelsinger , a former VMware CEO and longtime Intel executive who now serves as its chief executive, to revive its leadership status in the chips industry. The company has recently benefited from CHIPS and Science Act funding to create more microchip-manufacturing capabilities in Arizona. And it made a series of acquisitions to catch up on developing more advanced architectures and profit from the artificial-intelligence boom. Intel's American manufacturing efforts are a big gamble for the company's future. Each new semiconductor fabrication plant can take billions of dollars and three to four years to complete, time that Intel may not have. Even if Qualcomm acquired Intel , it's unclear what it would do with Intel's manufacturing operations. While Intel has built Ohio factories , major chip designers have not publicly signed up. "They just dropped the ball there, and until now, they're trying to build the foundry business. But they haven't even proven that they can make stuff for themselves yet," Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said. Advertisement A series of unfortunate events Intel was instrumental to the personal-computer boom in the 1990s, designing and manufacturing cutting-edge microprocessors. With its x86 central processing units, Intel drove rivals such as AMD out of the market. Related stories Because of its focus on PCs, Intel chose not to capitalize on mobile-chip growth in the 2000s — a big mistake because of the iPhone boom. In a 2013 interview with The Atlantic, Paul Otellini, then Intel's departing CEO, expressed regret over passing up a deal with Apple to design and manufacture chips for the iPhone before the smartphone was introduced. The two companies could not reach an agreement because Intel's forecasts said that volume would not make up for the cost. "We ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it," Otellini told The Atlantic. "And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong, and the volume was 100x what anyone thought." Advertisement Another opportunity came along when OpenAI approached Intel for an investment . OpenAI wanted to reduce its reliance on Nvidia's chips for its AI and build its own infrastructure. The deal fell through, and Reuters said Intel's leadership didn't think generative-AI models would make it to the market soon. That bet would later come back to bite Intel, and now OpenAI has billions in backing from Microsoft . Intel bought the deep-learning startup Nervana Systems in 2016 to invest in AI. The chipmaker later ceased operations at Nervana and placed its bets on the Israeli startup Habana Labs , which it acquired for $2 billion in 2019. Habana helped launch Intel's next-generation Gaudi AI chip for businesses this year. Intel's lack of GPUs While Intel focused on CPUs, competitors like the chip designers AMD and Nvidia hedged their bets with graphics processing units, which could assist with accelerated computing, a critical need for training AI. "They didn't really have a GPU product road map," Rasgon said. Advertisement Intel once had a stand-alone graphics chip called Larrabee in beta development. However, the project was canceled in 2009 and converted to a software-development platform after failing to hit performance targets. "Nvidia's dominance didn't come from luck. It came from vision and execution. Which Intel lacked," said an X post from Bryan Catanzaro , the vice president of applied deep-learning research at Nvidia, who previously worked at Intel as an intern on the Larrabee project. The CPUs that made Intel big now have presented what Logan Purk, a senior analyst at Edward Jones, called "the inventor's dilemma," when newer technology replaces incumbents. "I think management just rested on their laurels, so to speak, and there wasn't a strong competitor nipping at their heels to force them to continue to push that innovation," Purk said. Advertisement Manufacturing delays Intel's customers and rivals took their silicon business overseas to cut costs. Companies like AMD and Nvidia decided to leapfrog on chip designs while outsourcing manufacturing. Intel's manufacturing capabilities fell behind its customer demands. It ran into delays for its chips while TSMC was shipping chips for Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm. In 2020, Intel announced a delay to its 7-nanometer chips due to a "defect mode" that would have been key for its next generation of chips. Samsung and TSMC soon announced more advanced manufacturing capabilities, fitting more transistors in a processor and leaving Intel behind once again. After using Intel's chips for 15 years on its MacBooks, Apple debuted its in-house chip design with the M1 in 2020 and contracted out manufacturing to TSMC. Intel is now placing its bets on the 18A chip and its Xeon-data-center chips. Gelsinger's latest announcements point to the creation of an independent subsidiary for Intel's foundries, which would allow for more independence to obtain and borrow capital. Advertisement A potential Qualcomm merger A cash rescue could be coming. The mobile-chip maker Qualcomm approached Intel to acquire its chip-designing business and, later, for a merger deal , Reuters and the Journal reported, respectively. Apollo Global Management has also offered an "equity-like" investment of up to $5 billion, Bloomberg said. "If Intel was to be acquired by like a Qualcomm or a Broadcom , or any of these other big chip companies, that would be one of the biggest deals that has ever occurred in the chip space, like monumental," Dan Morgan, a senior trust portfolio manager at Synovus, said. A merger could also reinvigorate the Biden administration's efforts to position the US as a global chip-manufacturing hub and create a competitor capable of challenging Nvidia's monopoly in the AI-chip market, Morgan said. Though it would help Qualcomm diversify its products, a takeover would be a difficult bridge between the two companies and wouldn't patch up Intel's weaknesses, analysts have said. Advertisement "Now, you're buying their PCs and servers at present, but you're buying all the issues in their foundry business," Morgan said. "Why would you want to get involved in that? That is a huge undertaking."

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Sep 24, 2024, 01:54pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares China Central Bank Meeting Overview At 9 a.m., the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng led a press conference along with China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Wu Qing and State Administration for Financial Regulation’s head Li Yunze. They announced the following: Banks' Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) will be reduced by 0.5%, with another cut of 0.25% to 0.5% “at an appropriate time.” This move effectively gives banks another RMB 1 trillion to lend. The 7-day reverse repo rate was lowered by 0.20% to 1.50%. This rate determines the medium-term lending facility and bank deposit rate. Existing mortgages were reduced by 0.50%, which will “…benefit 50 million households," which represents approximately 150 million people, "and the total annual interest expense per household will be reduced by about 150 billion yuan.” The minimum down payment ratio for first and second mortgages was reduced by 15%. He also reiterated that the PBOC created a RMB 300 billion fund to support affordable housing in May. RMB 500 billion, with more provided “depending on the future situation,” will be provided to brokerage houses, mutual funds, and insurance companies to buy Mainland-listed stocks through ETFs and large-cap stocks. “Guide commercial banks to provide loans to listed companies and major shareholders for repurchasing and increasing holdings of listed company stocks” at a rate of 1.75% interest. Increase Tier 1 capital for the six large banks. Other measures mentioned included encouraging mergers and acquisitions, promoting long-term capital in the markets, supporting private equity, optimizing the policy of renewing loans for small and medium enterprises, and encouraging venture capital. Key Observations Is this the policy bazooka? It's pretty close. The press conference was held at 9 a.m. to ensure investors were aware it was taking place. The PBOC Governor’s speech was straight to the point, outlining in detail what was going to be done. The stock market did not really react until the stock market support fund was announced. While many banks have cut their China GDP forecast below 5%, the Chinese government has not. This represents a clear indication that the Mainland market’s decline is not going to be tolerated. Real estate policy support is like turning a supertanker. The mortgage and down payment will help, though it will take time. IT will be important to see how consumers react. Will we see more fiscal policy? I believe we will, as indicated by yesterday’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) release on supporting automobile and home appliance purchasing. The move comes against a backdrop of very low China equity ownership. The move, just prior to quarter end, will put pressure on managers to allocate. I’ve been shocked at how low China allocations remain amongst US institutional investors. Remember how pundits said China wouldn’t make any big policy moves before the US election? WRONG. I don’t think they care who wins. It is too early to know whether Hong Kong or Mainland China stocks will benefit more. Key News Asian stock markets were largely higher, with Hong Kong and Mainland China outperforming on MASSIVE IVE volumes. Hong Kong's volume reached 236% higher than the 1-year average volume, while Mainland China reached 124% higher than the 1-year average volume, along with extremely high advancers versus decliners. There were very broad rallies as the stimulus has a little something for everyone as brokers will benefit from the equity support. Yes, Southbound Stock Connect was a net sell, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF was a large net sell, though their market timing track record is awful. Alibaba was another net buy via Southbound Stock Connect with $393 million of net buying, bringing the total to $3.807 billion since being added on September 10 th . Tencent bought 2.53 million shares today as their buyback rolls on. All in all, it was a very strong day, as the numbers speak for themselves.

Intel explores $5 billion investment offer from Apollo amid market decline | TechSpot Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust . In a nutshell: It seems that beleaguered Intel has finally received some good news. According to reports, US asset management company Apollo Global Management has offered to invest up to $5 billion into Team Blue, which was recently rumored to be an acquisition target for Qualcomm. Apollo has indicated in recent days that it would be willing to make an equity-like investment of up to $5 billion in Intel, reports Bloomberg , citing one of the people familiar with the matter. Intel's executives are said to be weighing the proposal, adding that talks regarding the deal are in the early stages and may not lead anywhere. The size of Apollo's investment could change, too. Apollo Global Headquarters Increasing the likelihood of Apollo's investment is its previous relationship with Intel. The firm said earlier this year that it would acquire a 49% equity interest in a joint venture that controls Intel's new manufacturing plant in Ireland for $11 billion. The news comes at a tumultuous time for Intel. Once the world's most valuable chip manufacturer, its market cap has crashed from $290 billion in 2020 to $93.19 billion today, while the share price has lost 50% of its value this year alone. // Related Stories Intel Arrow Lake-S CPU gets delidded ahead of launch, showcasing tiled architecture OpenAI's Sam Altman dismissed as "podcasting bro" by TSMC over $7 trillion proposal Intel's share price over the last five years Intel has implemented a cost-reduction plan that will see more than 15% of its employees laid off before the end of the year, while operational expenses are being cut by more than $10 billion. It is also splitting its struggling foundry division into an independent subsidiary. Last weekend saw reports that rival tech giant Qualcomm had made a takeover offer for Intel, with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon personally involved in the negotiations. Such a deal could represent the largest tech acquisition ever, though it would undoubtedly face the scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Intel's shares have recovered slightly this month, rising from $18.89 on September 6 to $21.84 today. Reports of the potential investment pushed the price up 2%, while CEO Pat Gelsinger's announcement of a deal with Amazon Web Services to co-invest in a custom AI semiconductor also boosted the shares. 6 comments 150 likes and shares Share this article: Featured on TechSpot Qualcomm delays Intel buyout decision until after US election Intel unveils Core Ultra 200 CPUs, architecture overhaul Most Popular 37 comments The Zero Click Internet 20 comments Python is still the most popular coding language, but challengers are gaining ground 30 comments Testing AMD's Zen 5 Performance Update: Ryzen 7 9700X, Windows 24H2, AGESA Update 8 comments Tiny 11 can shrink Windows 11 24H2 installation from 30GB to less than 4GB The first-ever portable Xbox is here, thanks to one very dedicated modder Load Comments 6 ...

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here . ~~~ 00:00:09 [Speaker Changed] This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio 00:00:15 [Speaker Changed] This week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Victor sla, founder, CIO of the $19 billion Strategic Value Partners. Victor has had a fascinating career, stood up the distressed debt department at Citibank before doing the same thing at Merrill Lynch a few years later. He also spent time at Sebus and More Capital before launching his own firm in 2001. They do everything from hard assets like real estate, infrastructure, aircraft, power plants, to private debt, event driven opportunities. Europe accounts for anywhere between a third and a half of their investments. They have a number of businesses that they’ve taken over through the debt side of the equation. 15 businesses with over 90,000 employees. Really just a fascinating person who has seen the distressed debt business from day one. He was there at the creation and has taken it to all sorts of really interesting places. I found this conversation to be absolutely fascinating if you’re at all interested in things like hard debt and what distressed asset buying is like, and what it’s like to take over a company, not through its equity, but through its defaulted debt. I, I think you’ll find this to be an absolutely fascinating conversation. I know I did. With no further ado, my discussion with Strategic Value Partners, Victor Kla. Victor Kla, welcome to Bloomberg. 00:01:56 [Speaker Changed] Thank you. Thanks for having me, Bob. 00:01:57 [Speaker Changed] So, so I skimmed over a lot of your, your cv We’ll, we’ll get to some more details in a little while. Let’s just start with your educational background. Bachelor of Commerce with honors from Delhi University, a Master’s in Economic from Vanderbilt, and then an MBA from the University of Chicago. So, is it, is it safe to say finance was always in the career plans? Oh, 00:02:22 [Speaker Changed] Gosh, yes. 00:02:23 [Speaker Changed] From, from the beginning. 00:02:24 [Speaker Changed] Finance and business was always in the career plans. Running a $19 billion private equity, opportunistic credit firm was not. Right. It isn’t like that was the plan 40 years ago. You, 00:02:40 [Speaker Changed] You, you just tack into what was working and continue to build on it. Talk a little bit about your professional experience, ’cause I find it absolutely fascinating. You are relatively young in your career when you’re at Citibank, or was it Citigroup then? I, I keep track. And you essentially created their distressed debt department. Te tell us about that experience. What was that, 25, 30 years ago? Maybe more. 00:03:07 [Speaker Changed] It was more, it was 30 years 00:03:10 [Speaker Changed] Ago, 1980s, late 00:03:12 [Speaker Changed] Eighties, early nineties. Right. When, when it happened. Yes. I worked in all the places Barry, you described, right, right. The two places. I think what’s really interesting is I was there at the beginning at the creation of a loan trading business. 00:03:30 [Speaker Changed] Like it did not exist at Citi or most of Wall Street. It, it did before the early nineties. 00:03:35 [Speaker Changed] It did not exist. This is totally novel exist. Bloomingdale’s filed for bankruptcy, S-C-I-T-V filed for bankruptcy, and for the first time banks, which owned the debt, wanted to sell. So 00:03:50 [Speaker Changed] They’re sitting on, they’re sitting on a lot of bad paper. Yeah. And they don’t really know what it’s worth. They don’t know what to do with it. How do they come to you and Citi and say, Hey, we’re stuck with all this paper and you know, we’d like to at least have a partial recovery. 00:04:05 [Speaker Changed] That was what really got it going. There was no price. You had to kind of analyze it to come up with a price. And at the same time, there were very few buyers, more and more sellers. So the pricing was really good where you could buy these loans. Right. 00:04:24 [Speaker Changed] So, so was Citi acting as a middleman looking for buyers of distressed debt? Or did someone like yourself have the insight and say, Hey, you know, at a hundred cents on the dollar, this is junk. But at 15, 20 cents, there’s some upside. 00:04:39 [Speaker Changed] At Citi and at Merrill, I ran a proprietary trading business. And proprietary trading is using the firm capital to kind of buy it and also to distribute it, to syndicated it more broadly at the same time. But, but I think if I was to go back through my career, that moment in time, you know, when there is this big wave coming, because it was the start of the high yield market, the leverage loan market grew dramatically, you know, from 200 billion in the mid nineties to $5 trillion today, high yield and leverage loans. Right. And these deals, which never used to trade in the secondary market, they started to change hands. I was there right at the beginning of that big wave. And, and what has happened to me career wise is just riding that wave as it got bigger, as it got more complicated as it became us and Europe, not just us, as it went from buying and selling distressed debt to going out and taking control of businesses, operating them and improving them. It was all set at that moment of time in the early nineties. 00:06:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s, let’s just stay in the early nineties at Citi for a few minutes. At the time, you’re early in your career, you have some experience, and an MBA when, when you first started hearing that from banks that, Hey, we got all this Bloomingdale debt. Tell us what went through your mind? Did you envision, oh, you know, there’s a market for here and there’s an opportunity. How, how did you look at this and then how did you stand up? That whole distressed debt department at city 00:06:31 [Speaker Changed] Banks are wanting to sell? I have worked at Booz Allen and Hamilton, I’m a strategic planning guy. I get hired by Citibank in planning. I work for a really senior guy in the investment bank. This business is just starting. I write a business plan for it. 00:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Like a legitimate, like it, like it’s a freestanding entity. Like, 00:06:56 [Speaker Changed] Like, you know, it’s a business. We should be like, 00:06:58 [Speaker Changed] It’s 00:06:58 [Speaker Changed] A startup. Yes. It’s a business we should be bigger in. We should grow in. And, and there were a couple of people inside Citibank who were pioneers in trying to buy and sell loans. Right? I get folded right into that group after writing the business plan. And boy, we are off to the races now. You know, when you look at something like a Bloomingdale’s, what you have to ask yourself is, Bloomingdale’s is restructuring. It’s going through a bankruptcy, right? It’s got the debt itself, which banks want to sell. You have to price it. And at this point in time, the bankruptcy processes, the restructuring processes weren’t that well developed, right? You had to really say, Hey, it’s a two year stint in bankruptcy, right? We are going to cut costs. We’ll make this business much more efficient right. As we do it. And then you say, what is the business worth? Right? 00:07:57 [Speaker Changed] And I, and at the time, they had a good name. Yeah. A good brand, fantastic real estate locations. So there was some assets that were salvageable. The question was, do we continue as a going concern or do we just liquidate? You guys just said, Hey, let’s, let’s reorganize this. ’cause there’s still value here. It’s not, we’re not just gonna sell it off for parts 00:08:20 [Speaker Changed] E Exactly. Right. And by the way, most of the businesses we invest in, there’s much more value, even like today, there’s much more value in fixing it, in transforming it than selling it for pots. But because these are really good businesses, which got levered, they got leveraged through these leverage buyouts. Right? But that valuation, to be able to come up with the valuation, to be then able to work in a restructuring process, bankruptcy process, and say, Hey, I think at the end of this, we are buying debt at 50 cents. It could be worth 80, 90 cents. It could take two to four years to kind of get there. That’s how this business started. Huh? It was just not well understood. Even the fact that there was a bankruptcy process, which could be two years long or three years long. Right. It was just not well understood in the early nineties. 00:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So I have so many questions for you about, ’cause this is such a, the nineties was such a fascinating era. So first, was this like a small side project at Citi? Or did the higher ups say, oh, Victor’s onto something, let’s put some capital into this and see where it goes. What were, what was the initial reaction within Citi? 00:09:44 [Speaker Changed] And by the way, don’t get me wrong, please. It wasn’t just Victor. I know it wasn’t just Victor. I 00:09:49 [Speaker Changed] Was a, it’s the, you know, anytime we talk about Merrill or City or UBS or Morgan, we’re always talking about big teams Yes. With a number of different people leading different departments. Yeah. All that said, you wrote the, the business plan. So, so how, how, how warmly was it embraced? Or was it, all right, give the kid a couple of bucks and let’s see how far this goes. 00:10:09 [Speaker Changed] It, it started out with give the kids a couple of bucks, right? And then what happened was, like, literally in the first few weeks, 00:10:19 [Speaker Changed] So not long at all, like immediate success, 00:10:22 [Speaker Changed] Boom, right there, we are starting to get in the middle of some of these secondary sales of debt. It’s almost like liftoff, right? Because the moment in time, you, you know, in those days, Barry, a lot of debt was owned by Japanese banks. And I recall European banks, right? 00:10:41 [Speaker Changed] Remember when everyone was terrified they were gonna buy Rockefeller Center and they’re gonna take over? Yeah. Everything around the late eighties, early nineties, that was peak Japan. Yeah. And they spent the next 30 years wandering in the desert. 00:10:53 [Speaker Changed] Well, they’ve had a tough few decades. Right? 00:10:56 [Speaker Changed] Right. Although they seem to be very much on the, on the comeback. But so immediately this looks successful. 00:11:01 [Speaker Changed] Typically 30% of the market was owned by Japanese banks. Really? 00:11:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s a giant number 00:11:08 [Speaker Changed] In the early nineties. Right? Wow. So now you have these restructurings, you have these bankruptcies, and the Japanese banks want to sell the debt. They drive it, then the European banks want to sell, because US bankruptcy in those days was not as well understood. Right. And then, boy, it, it was almost like bankruptcy filings boom, debt for sale, boom, boom. Wow. And it just took 00:11:35 [Speaker Changed] Off. And, and my recollection is that when foreign banks come into the US and buy up a bunch of assets or debt or whatever it is, and when they start to run into trouble back home, there’s usually a change of leadership. Hmm. And whoever the new owner of the foreign banks are, tend to say, Hey, I didn’t buy that junk. You guys just get rid of this. Whatever you can get for it, hit the bid. They’re very aggressive sellers. Or am I, am I misremembering this? 00:12:05 [Speaker Changed] They, they are, they are aggressive sellers and foreign banks, foreign institutions tend to be more aggressive. But there’s also a very, you know, there’s also a very economic reason for it, right? Because when you are in a restructuring, the debt you own has defaulted, right? And the central bank, which governs you, like the one in Japan, or like the one in the United States, right? They make you take reserves, mark it down, right? 00:12:34 [Speaker Changed] So you write it down to zero. So whatever you get for it is practically found money. You’ve already taken the hit. 00:12:40 [Speaker Changed] So there’s a very good economic reason why all you know, short, they’re far away, right? They don’t quite understand what’s going on. 00:12:49 [Speaker Changed] It’s a small part of their book. Right? Yeah. 00:12:51 [Speaker Changed] No. So the obvious reason, right? But then also the economic reason that, hey, I have it marked down. I have all these non-performing loans in my balance sheet. It’s creating a drag the way equity analysts look at my balance sheet. I should be selling, I should be getting out. Right? So, and by the way, it con continues to today, if you have a bankruptcy filing, you have a restructuring, right? They, they will sell the debt, they’ll sell it at a price, which is probably too low. But there’s a very sound economic reason for the banks or the CLOs to want to sell. 00:13:30 [Speaker Changed] They have a very different set of priorities than a pure distress debt buyer. Right? 00:13:35 [Speaker Changed] Exactly right. Huh. But Barry, can I tell you, but go back, go back to one thought though. I wanted to make sure it just came through. Early

Yardeni Says Fed Cut Raises Odds of ‘Outright Melt-Up’ in Stocks Read full article Yardeni Says Fed Cut Raises Odds of ‘Outright Melt-Up’ in Stocks · Bloomberg Alexandra Semenova Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 6:15 PM 3 min read Link Copied 12 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- US stocks can soar to fresh highs thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive half-point interest rate cut last week, but it also could cause inflation to resurface if central bankers don’t tread carefully, according to Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni. Most Read from Bloomberg Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport The latest policy decision lifted the odds of an “outright melt-up” in equity prices — like during the dot-com bubble when the S&P 500 Index roared 220% from 1995 to the end of the century — to 30% from 20%. He placed the chances of a bull market at 80%, while reserving a 20% probability for a 1970s-like scenario, when stock markets around the world were gripped by volatility due to inflation and geopolitical tensions. But there’s a broader risk if things start running too hot. “If they overheat the economy and create a bubble in the stock market, they’re creating some issues,” the founder of eponymous firm Yardeni Research Inc. said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Monday. He added that the Fed is ignoring the upcoming US presidential election, in which both candidates are proposing policies that could trigger inflation. The remarks come as policymakers reiterate confidence in their decision to deliver an outsized cut to kick off the easing cycle. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Monday said he supported the half-point reduction but that he expects smaller quarter-point moves at the November and December meetings. Meanwhile, his Atlanta counterpart Raphael Bostic said last week’s large move will help bring interest rates closer to neutral levels as the risks of managing inflation and employment become more balanced. Stocks had a tough start to the month, with the S&P 500 Index dropping more than 4% in the first week. But since then, investor confidence that officials can engineer a soft landing has grown, putting the broad equities benchmark on pace for its best September — historically the index’s worst month of the year — since 2019. Yardeni again leaned into his idea that markets are in a new “Roaring ’20s” period, marked by productivity, growth and substantial equity returns. However, he said his odds of such a scenario fell to 50% from 60% previously. The soothsayer, typically among the most bullish forecasters on Wall Street, has an S&P 500 target of 5,800, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of strategists. That once eye-popping forecast now looks in line with many of his optimistic peers, who’ve steadily lifted their outlooks to keep up with the S&P 500’s 20% rally this year. Story continues BMO Capital Markets has the highest call for the US stock benchmark at 6,100, while Evercore ISI sees the gauge closing at 6,000 by year end. On the other end of the spectrum, Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., warned last week that the market is in a dot-com-bubble “Groundhog Day,” and said stocks could plunge by up to 13% by the fourth quarter.

Big UK investors poised to buy the dip in US property Read full article FILE PHOTO: The logo of Legal & General insurance company is seen at their office in central London · Reuters Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 7:11 AM 2 min read Link Copied 2 In this article: By Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise LONDON (Reuters) - British investment managers Legal & General and Schroders are to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in commercial property in the United States, but are largely steering clear of the hard-hit office sector, the companies told Reuters. The fund managers, which oversee more than 1.9 trillion pounds ($2.5 trillion) of assets between them, said they had separately been building up their U.S. real estate teams to make the push, anticipating that property prices will recover, aided by falling interest rates. Legal & General CEO António Simões told Reuters that U.S. real estate was a key expansion market for the company, adding that the market's fundamentals remained strong. Higher borrowing costs and widespread adoption of home working post-pandemic have hit property prices globally, with the U.S. office market hit particularly hard and investors still nervous about oversupply. But expectations of more interest rate cuts after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a bumper 50 basis points reduction last week have improved the investment outlook. Property analysts also said the U.S. market tends to reset faster than continental Europe, with lenders and developers quicker to reprice assets. L&G plans to expand its fledgling U.S. real estate equity portfolio by hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years, while adding a similar level of exposure in its more established real estate debt business, the company said. The fund manager has built a team of around 20 people in Chicago to help with the equity investment push, with a focus on rental homes across the country that have fared better than offices. Schroders said it was aiming to grow its own nascent U.S. real estate equity portfolio from tens of millions of dollars currently, to hundreds of millions over the medium term. The firm this month made an investment in a pan-American data centre portfolio, one of its initial forays. "We see the beginning of the Fed journey to normal interest rates as a key to unlock some pent-up demand," said Michelle Russell-Dowe, co-head of private debt and credit alternatives at Schroders Capital, the London-listed manager's private markets arm. Schroders has also identified opportunities in real estate debt, as banks retreat due to tougher capital rules. "The scale of the opportunity is huge," said Jeffrey Williams, a New York-based investor at Schroders. "There's a big gap in financing that other lenders are going to have to fill." The company said it was not averse to office investments, but they would need to be high quality developments. Story continues British insurer Phoenix's fund arm, which manages around 290 billion pounds, told Reuters it also planned to "invest considerably" in U.S. real estate but declined to give details on the scale of potential investment.

High-Speed Traders Made $7 Billion in Indian Options Market Boom Read full article 1 / 3 High-Speed Traders Made $7 Billion in Indian Options Market Boom Chiranjivi Chakraborty and Ashutosh Joshi Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:21 AM 2 min read Link Copied 1 (Bloomberg) -- Algorithms helped foreign funds and proprietary trading desks pocket 588.4 billion rupees ($7 billion) in gross profits from trading Indian equity derivatives, a study by the nation’s market regulator showed. Most Read from Bloomberg Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport The bulk of the gains came at the expense of individual traders and others, who lost a combined 610 billion rupees dabbling in stock futures and options in the financial year ended March, according to the study published Monday. The findings align with the Securities & Exchange Board of India’s push to slow the growth of the derivatives segment, whose turnover has skyrocketed over 40-fold since 2019, reaching a record $6 trillion in February — surpassing the size of India’s economy. SEBI has repeatedly cautioned small investors that they are taking a big risk in trying to bet against better-funded and more experienced financial market players. “There is little scope for individual traders to beat a mathematically-written model,” said Karthick Jonagadla, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based Quantace Research and Capital Pvt. “Trading equity options is altogether a different beast and chances of having a reward-to-risk ratio in your favor are minuscule.” India’s derivatives market grabbed global attention in April after US-based Jane Street Group revealed that a strategy used in the country generated $1 billion in profits. The revelation also shed light on how smaller investors are often at the wrong end of the trade. Nine out of every 10 retail derivatives traders lost money during the three-year period ended March, with the average loss per trader at about 200,000 rupees, SEBI’s latest study showed. Only 1% of traders made profits of over 100,000 rupees. More than 75% of the 10 million individual traders in India declared annual income of less than 500,000 rupees. A large part of the growth in India’s derivatives market was fueled by the start of weekly-expiring contracts in 2019, which replaced the traditional month-end expirations. These shorter-duration options stoked volumes, benefiting the National Stock Exchange of India, which has over 90% market share, and stock brokers.

The big story Lacking confidence Getty Images; Rebecca Zisser/BI The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Advertisement Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit , writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. Advertisement It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. Spencer Platt/Getty, Tyler Le/BI The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Advertisement Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again.

The city's electricity rates have been between 16-20% higher than the national average in recent years, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics , and residents are increasingly looking to save money and go green by installing solar panels. "Philadelphia is perfect for solar," said Liz Robinson, executive director of the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association , a local educational nonprofit. "The southeastern corner of Pennsylvania has the highest insolation, which means the highest number of solar days, compared to the rest of the state." Solar panels are a good fit for Philadelphia for other reasons, too. The city is built on a north-south rectilinear grid, an ideal orientation for catching rays. Many neighborhoods have minimal tree cover, and flat roofs on the city's many row houses make installation easier. Robinson notes that because electricity rates tend to be higher there than elsewhere in Pennsylvania, residents can save more on their electric bills. Can solar panels save you money? Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we’ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings. "When you install solar panels here in Philly, you're getting a little faster payback than you would if you were in another part of the state," she said. Here's a look at the best solar installers in Philadelphia, plus tips on tax incentives, installation factors and payment options for the City of Brotherly Love. Best national solar panel companies in Philadelphia Here's a look at the best solar installers among national companies that operate in Philadelphia. Tesla Solar Most affordable Read full review Tesla's solar branch seems to be the least loved of Elon Musk's ventures. Even Tesla's Solar Roof seems to get more love. If price is the thing you won't budge on, consider Tesla. By all accounts, Tesla installs quality panels and makes the closest thing there is to a household name in solar storage: the Powerwall. Where you might miss out is customer service. Discussion online seems to suggest Tesla's service is a bit of a gamble. Equipment 7.3 / 10 Warranty 6.5 / 10 Service 8 / 10 . . .

You can save thousands of dollars, without sacrificing on quality of equipment or the warranties that protect it. What you might sacrifice is customer service. From delays to price changes, to slow responses, to system malfunctions, social media reports of negative experiences aren't hard to find, including some who regret their choice. This is true of all solar companies, but the quantity of reports concerning Tesla is concerning.

The company has a dual mission of installing residential and commercial solar while also providing solar industry education and career opportunities to Philly residents. Solar States is a member of the Solar Energy Industries Association and a member of solar cooperative Amicus, which vets equipment suppliers and helps member companies get discounted pricing. See at Solar-states Evoke Solar Evoke Solar is another longtime installer in the Philly area, with 13 years of service in the region. This full-service solar design company is NABCEP-certified and operates in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Evoke is one of the few companies in Pennsylvania that installs SunPower panels, which come with a 25-year warranty. Installs typically include a five-year warranty on workmanship. See at Evokesolar How to determine which solar company is best for me In addition to reading online reviews and checking the Better Business Bureau to vet solar installers in Philadelphia, you'll want to check that companies are certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). Robinson also recommends asking friends and neighbors who have gone solar for referrals to a dependable installer. "Look for a company with staying power," she said. "Because the system lasts so long, and you will have to replace your inverter at some point, you want a contractor who's highly experienced and is going to be there in 10 or 15 years." Cost of solar panels in Philadelphia The cost of solar panels in Philadelphia depends on several factors, including the size of the system and labor costs. Equipment, including the panels and inverters—which can account for as much as 50% of the price tag—can also make an installation more or less expensive. Factors like electricity rates and incentives like net metering or selling SRECs can also affect your payback period. Getty Images Installing a solar battery along with your system will drive up the cost significantly; these can add anywhere from $12,000 to $22,000 to the total. You'll also want to get your roof in good shape before installation, so you may need to factor in repairs or replacement. Other costs, like permitting, racking, site surveying and maintenance, also contribute to the final cost. In Pennsylvania, the average cost to install solar panels is around $28,400 before incentives, with an average price per watt of $3.55—less than the national average. However, that total cost can be reduced by 30% with tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act , plus other potential incentives. Related costs like roof repair or replacement and solar batteries can be bundled into that 30% credit. Philadelphia solar panel installation cost Typical system size (kW) Price per watt Total installed cost (before incentives) Total cost after 30% federal tax credit Philadelphia/Pennsylvania 8 $3.55 $28,400 $19,880 National average 6.67 $3.67 $31,558 $22,091 Philadelphia solar panel incentives and rebates Federal, state and city incentives can make going solar in Philadelphia more affordable. Plus, there's another long-term perk: Installing solar panels has been shown to increase your home's property values by a national average of 4.1%, according to a study by real estate listing site Zillow. Philadelphians can also take advantage of Solarize Philly , a project of the Philadelphia Energy Authority that has helped 3,300 households install solar since 2010. Residents can access pre-negotiated discounts with vetted solar installers participating in the program. Another perk of Solarize Philly, Robinson said, is that the program will manage the process of connecting your system to PECO, the local electric utility. Solarize is currently only available to city residents, but Inflation Reduction Act funding has allowed the program to expand into the entire five-county region. Robinson estimated that Solarize Greater Philadelphia will be available to Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties sometime in 2025. Philadelphia residential solar incentives Program Description Federal residential clean energy credit This incentive gives homeowners who install solar panels a tax credit of 30% of the total cost of the project. Net metering Pennsylvania's state-governed net metering policy entitles Philadelphia residents who go solar with the full retail price of the power they sell back to the electric utility as a bill credit. State-level tax credit No Solar Alternative Energy Certificates (SAECs) Pennsylvania residents can earn one SAEC, the state's equivalent to an SREC, for every megawatt generated by their system, then sell those credits on the state's open market. Philadelphia Solar Rebate This city program, which provided a rebate of $0.20 per watt for residential solar projects, is currently closed due to budget cuts related to COVID-19. However, Philadelphia residents who installed solar on or after July 1, 2019, can apply for the waiting list and may be eligible for the rebate in the event that funding is restored. Community solar No Sales tax exemption No Property tax exemption No Installation factors to keep in mind Before you install solar in Philadelphia, consider these factors that can affect the cost, payback period, and efficacy of your panels. Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection has also compiled resources for homeowners considering solar that can help you think through the process. Your roof: The orientation and condition of your roof are a big factor in deciding whether solar panels are worth it. Robinson noted that in some areas of Philadelphia, especially lower-income neighborhoods, roofs may have more than the two recommended layers of material, which presents a safety issue when racking and panels are installed. She also recommends white-coating your roof before installation to protect and add longevity to the material and help keep your home cool. A reputable installer can assess your roof and help you make this decision. Tree cover and other shade: While many Philly neighborhoods have relatively little tree cover, neighboring buildings or shade can significantly affect the performance of your panels. In particularly leafy neighborhoods such as Mt. Airy and Chestnut Hill, homes may not be a good fit for solar. Philadelphia state peak sun hours: Compared to the rest of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia receives more sun. The state of Pennsylvania receives between 3.6 and 4.1 peak sun hours each day on average; experts recommend that your home receive at least four peak sun hours per day for solar panel installation to be worth it. HOA regulations: Consider any HOA regulations that might affect your ability to install solar. Pennsylvania does not have solar access laws or legislation that prevents HOAs from banning solar panels for residents. Homeowner's insurance: Installing solar panels may have an effect on your homeowner's insurance premiums or on your policy's coverage limits. Renting vs. owning: The cost and permanence of solar makes installing panels practical for homeowners, not renters. Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles, has more than 11,000 solar panels. Does the stadium's solar capacity top the NFL? Philadelphia Eagles How to pay for solar panels in Philadelphia Though they'll save you money in the long run, solar panels can be a big upfront investment. It's important to understand the pros and cons of each payment method, including how factors like interest or fees could affect your payback period. You'll also want to think about when and how to pay for solar in relation to your current electricity bills. Cash If you've got it, cash is the best way to pay for your solar panels. Your payback period won't be extended by high interest rates or fees on a loan, and you'll start saving money on your electric bill right away. If you don't have $15,000 to $30,000 lying around, you can make the most of higher savings interest rates with a high-yield savings account , certificate of deposit, money market account or even US Treasury I-Bonds to grow your nest egg for a future install. Solar loan Many solar installation companies offer solar loans or work with third-party

Advertisement The Cheng family is one of Hong Kong's most prominent and richest families, owning billions in property and a bustling jewelry business that's a household name in Asia. Bloomberg estimated their net worth to be $22.7 billion in March, though it's since fallen to $17.7 billion in September. The family's company, New World Development, oversees about 41.5 million square feet of property — more than all of Central Park — in Hong Kong, Asia's most expensive city for real estate. The Cheng clan revolves around the families of two brothers, though the elder and his children have long been considered the main force in the business. Advertisement As he nears 80, the family patriarch is expected to name a successor. But he's been coy so far with his plans, and rumors of a possible family feud abound in Hong Kong. The suspense turned into turmoil on Thursday, when his eldest son, assumed for years to be the one to take over, announced his resignation as CEO just after the company announced its first loss in decades. Here's what you need to know about the Chengs, a family whose massive wealth is rooted in the city's early days: Advertisement The Chengs' wealth comes from their grandfather, a jeweler turned real-estate mogul. Cheng Yu-tung, center, ran a property empire birthed from the profits of his jewelry business. Jonathan Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Image The Chengs' empire can be traced back to World War II, when their grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung, started working as an apprentice at a gold shop in Macau called Chow Tai Fook. In 1943, he married the daughter of the shop's owner, and shortly after, he moved to Hong Kong to open the store's first branch. As the Asian financial hub's affluence accelerated after the war, so did Cheng's business, which specialized in 24-karat gold jewelry. The jeweler invested his profits heavily in real estate during the 1970s, starting a company called New World Development. Now publicly listed, it owns department stores, hotels, and infrastructure across mainland China, Hong Kong, and the US. Cheng died in 2016 at the age of 91, when he was worth about $14.6 billion. His elder son, Henry, took over the jewelry and real-estate empire. With the 77-year-old Henry now signaling that he may be looking for a successor, his two eldest children, Adrian and Sonia, have entered the spotlight. Each has been running a key pillar of the family's property business for more than a decade, so they're considered the de facto contenders for their father's position. Both oversaw meaningful expansions in their primary fields — hotels for Sonia and commercial real estate for Adrian — and have worked to transform their properties into cultural icons for younger generations. Advertisement Sonia runs the family's hotel business, turning it into a sprawling collection of resorts and luxury locations. Sonia Cheng, left, is the head of the Rosewood Hotel Group, which owns 51 hotels and is planning more than two dozen others. The group includes the Carlyle in New York City. Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images for The Business of Fashion and Thomas Iannaccone/Penske Media via Getty Image Sonia, 43, studied applied math at Harvard University before working as a real-estate banker for Morgan Stanley and in private equity for Warburg Pincus, according to a 2019 profile by CNBC . In 2008, she joined her family's business at age 28, becoming CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group three years later when the Chengs purchased the properties from Rosewood Corp. and Maritz, Wolff & Co . The luxury hotel brand owned 19 properties at the time, including the glamorous Carlyle hotel in Manhattan, which celebrities flock to when they visit for the Met Gala. With Sonia at the helm, Rosewood has since expanded into a global powerhouse for luxury hotels, with 34 locations and another 24 on the way. It's pushed hard into mainland China under the brand name New World Hotels, opening 16 more properties in cities such as Beijing, Sanya, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, for a total of 51 hotels and resorts. Sonia has often said she grew up in the hotel industry since her father, Henry, started his career as general manager of a hotel. She told the Singaporean outlet Channel News Asia that her philosophy had been to ditch stuffy hotel standards and attract younger travelers looking for tailor-made experiences. "There's a sense of discovery and curiosity when we go to hotels, we don't want to go to a place that doesn't reflect the local culture," she said. Rosewood's Hong Kong property ranked second on the World's 50 Best Hotels' 2023 list , with two other hotels in São Paulo and Paris earning spots as well. Sonia is married to Paulo Pong Kin-yee, who also comes from one of Hong Kong's wealthiest families, the Pongs . He's the founder of Altaya Group, a wine wholesaler, and the boutique restaurant company Classified Group, which runs five locations. Advertisement Adrian, the eldest sibling, helms his brand of billion-dollar megamalls that double as art museums. Adrian Cheng, pictured in the center at an event last year, launched K11's art malls in 2008. Keith Tsuji/Getty Images for K11 Adrian, 44, was long presumed to succeed his father as head of the family's wealth. The eldest of four siblings, he started his career as a banker at UBS and Goldman Sachs before diving into the family business in 2007. A year later, Adrian launched K11, his brand of malls and office buildings in Hong Kong and China that came with a unique selling point — a focus on showcasing art and designer work. Art has been core to his personal brand. A classical singer who trained on Broadway, he graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's in East Asian Studies. He's perhaps best known for K11 Musea, a $2.6 billion mall on Hong Kong's Victoria Dockside that has some 40 art installations and hosted Asia's first-ever Cannes Film Festival Week in 2019 . Adrian himself maintains a long list of personal art ventures, such as organizing a Louis Vuitton menswear fashion show in November and paying to save an iconic 1,300-seat cinema that opened in 1952. Seen for years as the heir apparent to the Cheng business empire, he's dominated the lion's share of headlines about the family. Like his sister, he led aggressive expansions for New World Development, pouring billions into residential and commercial buildings in Hong Kong and Chinese urban hubs. His vision is to bring K11 to nine Chinese cities in total, and he's now building a mall in Shenzhen that's estimated to cost $1.4 billion . A prolific investor, he's put money into more than 60 companies through his fund, C Ventures, including Shein, electric-vehicle makers such as XPeng, and the COVID-19 detection tech startup Prenetics. C Ventures declared assets of more than $700 million when it merged with a Swiss investment firm in July. Adrian is married to Jennifer Yu, who runs Chow Tai Fook Education, a collection of K-12 schools and play facilities, and Arch Education, a tutoring company. Advertisement Their father, Henry, hinted at a succession toss-up at a time when Adrian was expected to be heir. Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development, at a 2016 press conference on the company's financials. Jonathan Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Images In November, Adrian and Sonia's father turned heads in a television interview when he made a cryptic remark about his successor . "I'm still observing, but I think it's not so easy to identify such a person," Henry said, adding that if there was no one suitable, the Chengs could "hire from the outside." Each family member could continue to helm their own sector of the business, Henry said. That comment rattled what had for years been presumed by the business world as the plan for the Chengs — that Adrian would take over everything. By then, the family's net worth had reached $26 billion, and Adrian was already CEO of New World Development, though his father still controlled the family's assets. Bloomberg noted that Adrian's representatives had described him in 2020 as "the heir to New World Development and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises." Henry raised further uncertainty in December about his family's succession when Adrian and Sonia's younger brother Brian was placed in a top role in the company's construction and infrastructure arm . All three were poised to lead their own fiefdoms in the Cheng empire, with Henry's fourth child, Christopher, holding an executive directorship at the company. Their cousin and the vice-chairman of Chow Tai Fook, Conroy, denied in a November earnings press conference that there was any family infighting. But on Thursday, it became clear that the Chengs' traditional succession narrative had been thrown into disarray. Adrian announced that he would step down as CEO and become a non-executive director in the company. He would focus instead on public services, he told reporters at a press conference. Advertisement The Chengs have been beset by bleak market conditions as Hong Kong tries to regain its footing. The entrance of the K11 Art Mall in Hong Kong. NurPhoto/Getty Images The Chengs have had to weather an ailing property market in Hong Kong. The city suffered a rout among investors and residents after recent years of political turmoil, coupled with a weaker economy after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower demand for property from mainland China's wealthy buyers. Rising taxes and interest rates in the city have also slowed the market, hemming in New World Development after it gobbled up loans and new properties. The company's stock has dropped about 82% in the past five years. Adrian's resignation also comes as New World Development suffered a heavy blow under his leadership — its first annual loss in 20 years. In late August, the company reported that it expected to post a loss of up to $2.6 billion for the 2023 financial year, which ended in June. It was a sign of heavy pressure on the company, which is already considered one of Hong Kong's most indebted property developers. The Financial Times reported shortly after the announcement, citing several unnamed sources familiar with the company, that New World Development staff were growing worried about how quickly the Chengs were expanding. "Today we face one of the most challenging combinations seen in decades — from high interest rates to uncertain market conditions," Adrian said in a statement to the FT. "I believe this game of patience paired with consistency and dedication will eventually get us to our goals." He's been attempting to shore up confidence in Hong Kong's status as a financial hub, having started an institute in November to promote the city to the wealthy . "I'm very confident we will be No. 1 for family office wealth management in the future," he told Bloomberg in August. As Adrian exited the company's executive leadership on Thursday, New World Development's chief operating officer, Ma Siu-Cheung, became CEO. A representative for New World Development declined to comment for this story. September 27, 2024: This story was updated to reflect Adrian Cheng's resignation as CEO.

Advertisement Once a Silicon Valley leader, Intel has been a staple of the computer-chip-making business for decades. In the past several years, it has fallen from grace, failing to jump on the AI train in time. For decades, Intel led in chip design and manufacturing. A series of missed opportunities over the years has contributed to its current financial challenges. When The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Qualcomm had approached Intel for a takeover, tech forums were abuzz — and for good reason. A rescue for Intel is bound up with debates about the US's shifting role in the world's chip industry and the battle for dominance in the era of accelerated computing. Advertisement Intel has been trying to correct its course for years. In 2021, it brought back Pat Gelsinger , a former VMware CEO and longtime Intel executive who now serves as its chief executive, to revive its leadership status in the chips industry. The company has recently benefited from CHIPS and Science Act funding to create more microchip-manufacturing capabilities in Arizona. And it made a series of acquisitions to catch up on developing more advanced architectures and profit from the artificial-intelligence boom. Intel's American manufacturing efforts are a big gamble for the company's future. Each new semiconductor fabrication plant can take billions of dollars and three to four years to complete, time that Intel may not have. Even if Qualcomm acquired Intel , it's unclear what it would do with Intel's manufacturing operations. While Intel has built Ohio factories , major chip designers have not publicly signed up. "They just dropped the ball there, and until now, they're trying to build the foundry business. But they haven't even proven that they can make stuff for themselves yet," Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said. Advertisement A series of unfortunate events Intel was instrumental to the personal-computer boom in the 1990s, designing and manufacturing cutting-edge microprocessors. With its x86 central processing units, Intel drove rivals such as AMD out of the market. Related stories Because of its focus on PCs, Intel chose not to capitalize on mobile-chip growth in the 2000s — a big mistake because of the iPhone boom. In a 2013 interview with The Atlantic, Paul Otellini, then Intel's departing CEO, expressed regret over passing up a deal with Apple to design and manufacture chips for the iPhone before the smartphone was introduced. The two companies could not reach an agreement because Intel's forecasts said that volume would not make up for the cost. "We ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it," Otellini told The Atlantic. "And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong, and the volume was 100x what anyone thought." Advertisement Another opportunity came along when OpenAI approached Intel for an investment . OpenAI wanted to reduce its reliance on Nvidia's chips for its AI and build its own infrastructure. The deal fell through, and Reuters said Intel's leadership didn't think generative-AI models would make it to the market soon. That bet would later come back to bite Intel, and now OpenAI has billions in backing from Microsoft . Intel bought the deep-learning startup Nervana Systems in 2016 to invest in AI. The chipmaker later ceased operations at Nervana and placed its bets on the Israeli startup Habana Labs , which it acquired for $2 billion in 2019. Habana helped launch Intel's next-generation Gaudi AI chip for businesses this year. Intel's lack of GPUs While Intel focused on CPUs, competitors like the chip designers AMD and Nvidia hedged their bets with graphics processing units, which could assist with accelerated computing, a critical need for training AI. "They didn't really have a GPU product road map," Rasgon said. Advertisement Intel once had a stand-alone graphics chip called Larrabee in beta development. However, the project was canceled in 2009 and converted to a software-development platform after failing to hit performance targets. "Nvidia's dominance didn't come from luck. It came from vision and execution. Which Intel lacked," said an X post from Bryan Catanzaro , the vice president of applied deep-learning research at Nvidia, who previously worked at Intel as an intern on the Larrabee project. The CPUs that made Intel big now have presented what Logan Purk, a senior analyst at Edward Jones, called "the inventor's dilemma," when newer technology replaces incumbents. "I think management just rested on their laurels, so to speak, and there wasn't a strong competitor nipping at their heels to force them to continue to push that innovation," Purk said. Advertisement Manufacturing delays Intel's customers and rivals took their silicon business overseas to cut costs. Companies like AMD and Nvidia decided to leapfrog on chip designs while outsourcing manufacturing. Intel's manufacturing capabilities fell behind its customer demands. It ran into delays for its chips while TSMC was shipping chips for Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm. In 2020, Intel announced a delay to its 7-nanometer chips due to a "defect mode" that would have been key for its next generation of chips. Samsung and TSMC soon announced more advanced manufacturing capabilities, fitting more transistors in a processor and leaving Intel behind once again. After using Intel's chips for 15 years on its MacBooks, Apple debuted its in-house chip design with the M1 in 2020 and contracted out manufacturing to TSMC. Intel is now placing its bets on the 18A chip and its Xeon-data-center chips. Gelsinger's latest announcements point to the creation of an independent subsidiary for Intel's foundries, which would allow for more independence to obtain and borrow capital. Advertisement A potential Qualcomm merger A cash rescue could be coming. The mobile-chip maker Qualcomm approached Intel to acquire its chip-designing business and, later, for a merger deal , Reuters and the Journal reported, respectively. Apollo Global Management has also offered an "equity-like" investment of up to $5 billion, Bloomberg said. "If Intel was to be acquired by like a Qualcomm or a Broadcom , or any of these other big chip companies, that would be one of the biggest deals that has ever occurred in the chip space, like monumental," Dan Morgan, a senior trust portfolio manager at Synovus, said. A merger could also reinvigorate the Biden administration's efforts to position the US as a global chip-manufacturing hub and create a competitor capable of challenging Nvidia's monopoly in the AI-chip market, Morgan said. Though it would help Qualcomm diversify its products, a takeover would be a difficult bridge between the two companies and wouldn't patch up Intel's weaknesses, analysts have said. Advertisement "Now, you're buying their PCs and servers at present, but you're buying all the issues in their foundry business," Morgan said. "Why would you want to get involved in that? That is a huge undertaking."

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Sep 24, 2024, 01:54pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares China Central Bank Meeting Overview At 9 a.m., the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng led a press conference along with China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Wu Qing and State Administration for Financial Regulation’s head Li Yunze. They announced the following: Banks' Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) will be reduced by 0.5%, with another cut of 0.25% to 0.5% “at an appropriate time.” This move effectively gives banks another RMB 1 trillion to lend. The 7-day reverse repo rate was lowered by 0.20% to 1.50%. This rate determines the medium-term lending facility and bank deposit rate. Existing mortgages were reduced by 0.50%, which will “…benefit 50 million households," which represents approximately 150 million people, "and the total annual interest expense per household will be reduced by about 150 billion yuan.” The minimum down payment ratio for first and second mortgages was reduced by 15%. He also reiterated that the PBOC created a RMB 300 billion fund to support affordable housing in May. RMB 500 billion, with more provided “depending on the future situation,” will be provided to brokerage houses, mutual funds, and insurance companies to buy Mainland-listed stocks through ETFs and large-cap stocks. “Guide commercial banks to provide loans to listed companies and major shareholders for repurchasing and increasing holdings of listed company stocks” at a rate of 1.75% interest. Increase Tier 1 capital for the six large banks. Other measures mentioned included encouraging mergers and acquisitions, promoting long-term capital in the markets, supporting private equity, optimizing the policy of renewing loans for small and medium enterprises, and encouraging venture capital. Key Observations Is this the policy bazooka? It's pretty close. The press conference was held at 9 a.m. to ensure investors were aware it was taking place. The PBOC Governor’s speech was straight to the point, outlining in detail what was going to be done. The stock market did not really react until the stock market support fund was announced. While many banks have cut their China GDP forecast below 5%, the Chinese government has not. This represents a clear indication that the Mainland market’s decline is not going to be tolerated. Real estate policy support is like turning a supertanker. The mortgage and down payment will help, though it will take time. IT will be important to see how consumers react. Will we see more fiscal policy? I believe we will, as indicated by yesterday’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) release on supporting automobile and home appliance purchasing. The move comes against a backdrop of very low China equity ownership. The move, just prior to quarter end, will put pressure on managers to allocate. I’ve been shocked at how low China allocations remain amongst US institutional investors. Remember how pundits said China wouldn’t make any big policy moves before the US election? WRONG. I don’t think they care who wins. It is too early to know whether Hong Kong or Mainland China stocks will benefit more. Key News Asian stock markets were largely higher, with Hong Kong and Mainland China outperforming on MASSIVE IVE volumes. Hong Kong's volume reached 236% higher than the 1-year average volume, while Mainland China reached 124% higher than the 1-year average volume, along with extremely high advancers versus decliners. There were very broad rallies as the stimulus has a little something for everyone as brokers will benefit from the equity support. Yes, Southbound Stock Connect was a net sell, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF was a large net sell, though their market timing track record is awful. Alibaba was another net buy via Southbound Stock Connect with $393 million of net buying, bringing the total to $3.807 billion since being added on September 10 th . Tencent bought 2.53 million shares today as their buyback rolls on. All in all, it was a very strong day, as the numbers speak for themselves.

At the Money: Why Stocks Are Your Best Bet for the Long Run - The Big Picture Why Stocks Are Your Best Bet with Jeremy Schwartz, WisdomTree (September 25, 2024) Are equities the best long-term investment? If so, is that always true? In this episode of At the Money, we speak with Jeremy Schwartz about why you should, or should not, go heavy on stocks. ~~~ About Jeremy Schwartz: Jeremy Schwartz is Global Chief Investment Officer of WisdomTree, leading the firm’s investment strategy team in the construction of equity Indexes, quantitative active strategies, and multi-asset Model Portfolios. He co-hosts the Behind the Markets podcast with Wharton finance Professor Jeremy Siegel and has helped update and revise Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns & Long-Term Investment Strategies .

TRANSCRIPT [ Music: You can go the distance, we’ll find out, in the long run ] Barry Ritholtz : Stocks have outperformed every other asset class over the long run, assuming you measure the long run at about 20 plus years, real estate, gold bonds. It’s hard to find anything that has a track record as good as equities since the late 19th century. The challenge? Stocks can be risky, even volatile, over long periods of time, and there are so many different approaches to investing that it can get confusing. But as it turns out, there are some ways you can take advantage of equities as an asset class that work well if you’re a long term investor. I’m Barry Ritholtz, and on today’s At The Money, we’re going to discuss how to use equities in your portfolio for the long run. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your investing, let’s bring in Jeremy Schwartz. He’s the Global Chief Investment Officer at Wisdom Tree Asset Management and the longtime collaborator with Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel, whose book, Stocks for the Long Run, has become an investing classic. So Jeremy, let’s start with the basics. What does the historical data say about stocks? Jeremy Schwartz : Well, your intro hit it exactly perfectly. It has been the best long-term return vehicle. Now, you know, today’s a time we’re all thinking about inflation. We’ve had very high inflation. And this is where people say, well, does inflation change the case for stocks? And, you know, is, is higher inflation a risk to stocks thesis? And we say, you know, stocks are not just a good hedge. for inflation. They’re the best hedge for inflation. Barry Ritholtz : Right? If revenue goes up, if profits go up, stock prices are going to go up. Jeremy Schwartz : Yeah, over the very long term, you see stocks have done, in Siegel’s data, he had this 200 years plus of returns across stocks, bonds, bills, gold, the dollar. You had 6/5 to 7% over all long-term time periods, above inflation, okay? And that was a stable return. We could talk about factors that change that looking forward. But, you know, six, seven above inflation with a pretty smooth line. Nothing had that same stability of constant real returns over time. Barry Ritholtz : So we’re talking about the long run. How do you define the long run? What is the sort of holding period that investors should think about if they want to get all of those benefits? Jeremy Schwartz : We, we tend to think of 7 to 10 years as a good forward-looking indicator. There are periods where stocks can go down. The, the longest period we had in our data was 17 years of losses of purchasing power, so after inflation, purchasing power. Barry Ritholtz : 1966-82 or was it earlier than that? Jeremy Schwartz : Yeah, and that was exactly around that time. And, you know, bonds had a double that time period, so they had a thirty-five-year period, where it had negative real returns. You didn’t have TIPS bonds back in the day. TIPS are Treasury Inflation Protective Securities that get an adjustment for inflation, so the primary risk to bonds was that inflationary period. But you actually had negative. Tips yields not so long ago. Um, just before this recent increase in rates 18 months ago, you had negative yields, you know, Barry Ritholtz : So if I’m a long-term investor, if I’m gonna hold on to my portfolio for 10 or even better 20 years. What are the best strategies to use to capture those returns? Jeremy Schwartz : You know, we do believe very much in diversification, owning the full market. It is very tough to pick the individual stocks. When we talk about stocks for long run, you can have long-term losers. But when you buy a broad market portfolio, You’re getting that diversification. The winners tend to rise to the top over time. It renews all the time. And, owning the market cheaply, you can do that now much more than ever before, which is one of the reasons why you could pay more for the market than you did historically. It was much harder to get diversification than you can today. Barry Ritholtz : So we’ve talked about 66-82, 2000-2013, equities did poorly. More recently. The first quarter of 2020 and then pretty much all of 2022, stocks did poorly. What should investors do when equities are in a bear market? Jeremy Schwartz : Often when you’re in a bear market, it’s a good time to be thinking about adding to allocations versus selling from allocations. You got to think about The real long term probability of when do you lose? We often look at stocks versus T bills just as a simple way of doing that. And two thirds of the time, stocks do better than cash. You know, one third of the time, you’ll have stocks losing to cash. Uh, you know, the cash today is 5%. So people say, is that now a time to be thinking about those cash rates? But when you zoom out, you go from one year to five years, the odds of success for stocks go up to 75%. You zoom out to 10 years, it’s like 85%. And 20 years. It’s 99% of the time to stocks. [Just about always]. Almost always. So, we, we do say, look at the long term. Yes, you can have painful periods, but you got to think back to that long term opportunity of stocks versus cash. Barry Ritholtz : So, let’s talk about volatility and drawdowns. People tend to get nervous when the market is in the red. What do you think about dollar cost averaging or other approaches when stocks are in what might be a 3, a 5, a 7-year bear market? Jeremy Schwartz : If we’re coming off the holiday season, we had the Black Friday sales, Cyber Monday sales. You see prices go down, you get excited and you go buy. That’s really what you need to think about with stocks. They go on sale and you want to take the opportunity to buy. You don’t want to be selling at those very. panic-type sales. One of Professor Siegel’s good friends, Bob Schiller, wrote “ Irrational Exuberance; ” You get to these periods of irrational dis-exuberance where people get overly pessimistic about what’s ahead, and those are the times to be thinking about adding to your portfolio. Barry Ritholtz : We were talking about this in the office, especially for younger people, under 40, under 30, when markets pull back, they shouldn’t be dour about it. They have a 30 or a 40-year investment horizon. If you’re young and markets are in a sell off, shouldn’t you be more aggressive at that point, buying more equities? Jeremy Schwartz : Oh, for sure. I mean, it’s hard in that moment. You see the prices going down, and you’re, you start thinking the world’s gonna end, and people panic react, but that is the time when we think you should be adding. Barry Ritholtz : So what about other periods where we see equities underperforming a specific asset class, precious metals, or gold? How should an investor be thinking about that? Jeremy Schwartz : Gold has been one of those ideas of it’s an inflation hedge. It has kept up in Siegel’s 200 years of data. It has kept up with inflation, but delivered less than 1% a year over the last 200 years. So it’s been a good inflation hedge. It kept up, but not much more when stocks did 6% on top of inflation. So I think the, the hardest challenge is you can say, yes, I’m worried about inflation, gold, something to look at. We’ve done some things that wisdom tree looking at capital efficient investing, where we stack like gold on top of stocks, where you can get both of them without having to sell your stocks to buy gold. I think that’s one of the ways to think about gold. But over very long-term periods, stocks have been, you know, better long term accumulations of wealth. Barry Ritholtz : How should investors think about black swans? Events like the pandemic or the great financial crisis. What should they be doing during these panicky sell-offs? Jeremy Schwartz : Risk always exists. We’ve been living with these types of risks throughout all of time. They do seem to be more presence in our minds today. Even just the recent Hamas attack on Israel, has you worried about what’s going to happen around the world? And are they going to bring it to the U. S.? And all sorts of questions. These things always are there. They’re in the background. But that’s one of the things that gives stocks a risk premium. They’re premium returns because they have risk. If you didn’t to have risk of just being T bills, then you don’t get compensated for that risk that you’re taking. Barry Ritholtz : You mentioned Professor Bob Schiller, who’s done a lot of work with expected returns. How should investors think about equities when valuations are a little elevated? Jeremy Schwartz : It’s absolutely true. Stocks are more expensive than their history. But it’s also true, that bonds are more expensive than their history. So people say, again, I get 5% in risk-free treasuries. Should that lower the case for stocks? That’s the short-term rate. Um, you know, you got to look at tips, yields, tips are those inflation-protected securities, the 10-year tips are right around 2% today. You look at stocks, P’s below 20 called 18 to 19 forward PEs. That’s giving you a five to 6% earnings yield. So the equity premium of stocks versus tips is above 3%, which is exactly the same as Siegel’s 200 years of data. There was a 3$ equity premium. It was around three and a half a percent for bonds, a little bit over six and a half for stocks. Today, bonds are 2. You’re getting more than 5 in stocks, if we look again, seven to ten years out. And so they’re not expensive by historical standards on an equity premium basis over stocks versus bonds. And so, yes, they’re both lower than their 200-year data, but it’s a reasonable equity risk premium today. Barry Ritholtz : So what are the biggest challenges to staying invested for the long run? Jeremy Schwartz : It is really that short-term volatility and the sort of panic moments of all sorts of these risks that come up last few years has been fed in inflation. Now it’s geopolitics. I think it’s gonna be more about geopolitics over the next 12 months. And it is the Fed. The Fed, we think, is sort of rearview mirror and they’re on their way towards loosening policy. It’s now all about what’s happening on the world stage. But that’s noise in the short run that will create a lot of volatility. But over the long run, you look at that long-term compounding of 6% real after inflation returns is what we come back to. Barry Ritholtz : So to wrap up, investors who have a long-term time horizon, and let’s define that as better 20 years should own a diversified portfolio of equities. The caveat, they should expect volatility in the occasional drawdown, even a market crash now and again. It’s all part of the process. Long-term investors understand that they get paid to hold equities through uncomfortable periods. If it was easy, Everybody would be rich. You can listen to At The Money every week.

How stocks can roar by 10% into year-end, Citi US equity-trading head says Read full article Filip De Mott Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 2:09 AM 2 min read Link Copied 1 Business Insider The stock market could jump as much as 10% by the year-end, Citi's stock-trading strategy head said. Stuart Kaiser told Bloomberg TV that the uber-bull case is now "a plausible scenario." He said the economy only needs to avoid a recession, which will ultimately depend on the labor market. Wall Street is forecasting S&P 500 highs that reach past the 6,000 threshold . This bullishness may be well earned, Citi's Stuart Kaiser said. "The uber-bull case, I think, for all of this year has been: you avoid a recession, you get insurance cuts, right? And that is now a plausible scenario," the firm's head of US equity-trading strategy told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. If this is achieved, stocks can surge another 5% to 10% by the end of this year, Kaiser said. So far, the second half of those conditions have been met. This month, the Federal Reserve finally started reducing interest rates, in a move meant to prevent a future economic slump. This precautionary "insurance" cut — amounting to a 50-basis-point reduction to the federal funds rate — was embraced by stock investors, and indexes have since notched new record highs. To Kaiser's point, this will continue as long as a recession does not materialize. But though the Fed emphasized that it was not forecasting a looming downturn during its latest policy meeting, it all hinges on incoming labor market data, he noted. Since August, slipping employment conditions have been the core driver of slowdown fears. Investors will need to see labor figures remain intact in upcoming monthly data, or else recession outlooks could become increasingly valid. "Our view is risk reward is tough because it's really dependent on month-to-month," Kaiser noted, warning that recessionary prints would easily upend any Fed efforts to support the market. Other banks are also eyeing jobs data . According to Morgan Stanley, investors can celebrate if unemployment falls below 4.1% and non-farm payrolls reach over 150,000. This will be the best-case scenario for the market , keeping momentum going. Otherwise, trading should prepare for the worst if unemployment climbs above 4.3% and payrolls slide under 100,000. "The Fed puts not going to protect you if you get that kind of data, and that's why we think the risk reward is kind of a little bit off right now," Kaiser said.

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Sep 25, 2024, 10:59am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Key News Asian equities were mixed overnight as Mainland China outperformed and South Korea underperformed. Hong Kong and Mainland China opened higher after yesterday’s monetary policy bazooka. Still, they faded across the trading day, though both managed to post gains, especially the latter, on very higher volumes of 244% and 148% of the 1-year average, respectively. Skeptics are pointing to the lack of fiscal policy support, though yesterday’s monetary policy moves were completely unexpected and took investors by complete surprise. A bank reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut of 0.50% with another 0.25% to 0.50% wasn’t a shock, but we also had the 7-day reverse repo rate cut by 0.20%, which led to the loan prime rate (LPR) and deposit rates declining by 0.20%. We also had the mortgage rate reduced by 0.50%, a minimum down payment ratio reduced to 15% from 25%, and RMB 300 billion dedicated to support affordable housing. Overnight, the medium-term lending facility rate was reduced to 2% from 2.30%. What shocked investors the most was the RMB 500 billion fund dedicated to supporting the Mainland equity market investments, which could be increased if necessary, and RMB 300 billion to support corporate buybacks, which is unprecedented. Overnight, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced it would look to reform the mergers and acquisitions rules of listed companies. After the close, the State Council announced it would look at “implementing an employment priority strategy to promote high-quality full employment,” especially for college graduates. How this would occur was a bit opaque, less a focus on vocational skills training, though we can assume more policy will be coming. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor All sectors were positive in Mainland China as Northbound Stock Connect volumes were very high, indicating that overseas money came back into Mainland stocks. Did money come out of Japan and South Korea and back into "cheap" China? It is difficult to know. Mainland money came out of Hong Kong via Southbound Stock Connect with -$690 million of net selling, as Tencent and Meituan were net sells, though Alibaba had $336 million worth of net buying. Is Mainland money coming out of Hong Kong and going back into China a concern? No, because global investors are exceedingly underweight, with the rally coming a month/quarter end problematic for managers who have to disclose their holdings. Hong Kong growth stocks are where foreign investors will gravitate in my opinion, in addition to internet names that are actually growing fundamentally, unlike most of MSCI China. One factor in today’s fade-off of the highs is starting next Tuesday. Mainland China is closed for a week due to the National holiday. I would suspect an element of Hong Kong selling from the Mainland as profit-taking prior to the holiday from Mainland investors might occur. Hong Kong is only closed next Tuesday. Regardless, the dragon is awakening! The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +0.68% and +0.23%, respectively, on volume that increased+5% from yesterday, which is 244% of the 1-year average. 286 stocks advanced, while 194 declined. Main Board short turnover fell by -1.95% from yesterday, which is 270% of the 1-year average, as 19% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The value factor and large capitalization stocks outpaced growth and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Financials, up +2.28%, Energy, up +1.49%, and Materials, up +1.17%, while Information Technology fell -2.07% and Real Estate fell -0.93%. The top-performing subsectors included media, insurance, and capital goods. Meanwhile, technical hardware, food & beverage, and consumer services were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were very high as Mainland investors sold a net -$690 million of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy, Kuaishou, which was a small net buy, and Tencent and Meituan, which were large net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +1.16%, +1.24%, and +0.04%, respectively, on volume that increased +19% from yesterday, which is 148% of the 1-year average. 4,257 stocks advanced, while 727 stocks declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outpaced the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. All sectors were positive, led by industrials, which gained +2.19%, Financials, which gained +2.11%, and Communication Services, up +1.82%. The top-performing subsectors were diversified financials, construction, and heavy machinery. Meanwhile, oil & gas and computer hardware were among just a few negative subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were very high. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index gained versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds rallied. Copper and steel gained.

A New Definition For Equity In Education Skip to content 1.2k Views Facebook Twitter Equity In Education: A Definition by Terry Heick In a profession increasingly full of angst and positioning and corrective policy, there are few ideas as easy to get behind as equity. Equal. Equality. Equity. Equilibrium. Equate. These are all fine ideas—each tidy and whole, implying their own kind of justice while connotating the precision of mathematics. Level. Same. Twin. Each word has its own nuance, but one characteristic they share in common is access—a level, shared area with open pathways that are equidistant to mutually agreed-upon currencies. When discussing equity, there are so many convenient handles–race, gender, language, poverty, access to technology, but there may be a larger view that we’re missing when we do so. Equity is the idea and goal of fairness and inclusion to provi de all students with the resources, opportunities, and support they need to succeed, regardless of their background, abilities, or socioeconomic status. Unlike equality, which treats everyone the same, equity recognizes that students come from diverse circumstances and may require different approaches and resources to achieve similar outcomes. The Scale of Equity There isn’t a more global issue—equity being perhaps the global issue of our time. United Nation statistics published last year in The Economist put it plainly. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels. And elsewhere, in Chad and the Central African Republic, there is a flat-rate of less than 70 girls for every 100 boys.” This is a starkly different conversation about equity than the one we might have in the United States, the UK, Canada, or Australia. We have the luxury of becoming choosier, and harsher on ourselves, as progress is made, i.e., let’s first make sure there are free, quality schools everywhere, and that children can all read and write, and then at some point down the line we can concern ourselves with iPads vs Androids, or the broadband access in our poorest communities. It’s easy to miss the scale of this as an ‘issue’ because unlike assessment, curriculum, teacher pay, class sizes, educational technology, or any other persistently evergreen edu-choke point, equity never stops affecting. It’s both the center and periphery of everything because we’re always who we are, where we are. The Cultural Effect As a species, we express ourselves through differences. What makes ‘culture’ interesting is how it both recognizes the individual while simultaneously allowing them to disappear into the whole again. In culture, there is both identity and anonymity. There is a constant self–>group transaction that is based on both affection (inward expression) and image (outward expression). This transaction is then repeated across cultures, with completely different functions. Differences within and across cultures are differences nonetheless, but the individual can think while groups simply gather. So this is a brutally narrow take on how people gather and cohort and manifest their vision of what it means to be human, but the point remains: As educators, we suffer that same reductionism when we see the masses the same way Nielsen does television ratings. Students aren’t demographics, and it’s murky at best to see how treating them that way has improved their lot or our shared progress. While squinting and trying to narrow gaps, it’s too easy to lose the scale and product of our work. The segmenting of Mackenzie and Andrew into a group, and that group into a subgroup, and their understanding into data, and the knowledge we hope they come away with into standards we can teach with—this all becomes a tone—a posture dictates the terms of teaching and learning. Equity in the classroom is different than in the job market. A subcorollary is that we all share equity and inequity, both in possession and effect. In “The Hidden Wound,” Wendell Berry writes, “It may be the most significant irony in our history that racism, by dividing the two races, has made them not separate but in a fundamental way inseparable, not independent but dependent on each other, incomplete without each other, each needing desperately to understand and make use of the experience of the other…. we are one body, and the division between us is the disease of one body, not of two.” This is both abstract and practical. We share both living space and social membership. Somehow, though, public education, more so than any other industry or profession, is expected to aggregate these inherent disparities while transcending them. Our task? Create a curriculum that provides a common language for knowledge without homogenizing the nuance of that knowledge Design learning models that are inherently inclusive regardless of access to technology Establish authentic functions for family members and communities who may speak a completely different language As individuals, we work to separate ourselves—as children, often based on image, and as adults, often based on income, where we choose to live, what we drive, the smartphone we carry, and what we choose to do “for a living.” But each of these expressions of who we are–gender, native language, race, sexuality, socioeconomic level, and so many others–are also opportunities for disparity all work to undermine the function of education. It’s easy to see equity in education as a matter of fairness, access, and inclusion, but that’s only the case if what’s being fairly accessed is a system of teaching and learning that is able to meet the needs of an increasingly global population—that means fluid, responsive, dynamic, neutral, and alive. For an industry that struggles to get every student reading on grade level, this may be a bit much. My gut reaction, then, is that this can only occur through the affectionate expression of the local—this student in this home in this community, with the school functioning as an extraordinary support system. The equity is at the student level rather than the demographic level because demographics only exist in paperwork. For every student, there is commonness and there is difference; there is what’s shared (i.e., student needing knowledge), and there is distinction (e.g., poor, rural, white, black, male, female). This never stops. We can revise our schools, curriculum, pedagogy, and technology until it is inclusive, fair, and accessible to every student, but that’s been an ongoing effort that may represent a kind of basement for our goals. But why not consider something more ambitious? New thinking about the terms and definitions of gender emphasize both the characteristics and the fluidity of any culture. If we insist on standardizing content, maybe we can avoid standardizing education. How many different answers are there to, “Why learn?” Fantastic! Let’s iterate ourselves until we can honor that. The work before us, then, may not be to level an academic playing field for which there is no straight, but rather to create new terms for why we learn, how, and where—and then change the expectation for what we do with what we know. Simply guaranteeing access and inclusion into a body of content-based is no longer sufficient if our goals stretch beyond academic. A modern definition for equity in education may be less about equal, fair, or even, and more about personalization–a body of knowledge, habits, and networks that help each student realize their own perfectly unique potential. As for a definition for equity in education? How about, “eye-level access to curriculum, education models, and learning spaces that depend entirely on the native interests, knowledge demands, and human affections of learners individually.” Or more briefly, “a fully-realized system of learning that starts and ends with the humanity of each student.” A New Definition For Equity In Education; adapted image attribution flickr user helpingting and skotit; About The Author Terrell Heick Founder & Director of TeachThought

High-Speed Traders Made $7 Billion in Indian Options Market Boom Read full article 1 / 3 High-Speed Traders Made $7 Billion in Indian Options Market Boom Chiranjivi Chakraborty and Ashutosh Joshi Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:21 AM 2 min read Link Copied 1 (Bloomberg) -- Algorithms helped foreign funds and proprietary trading desks pocket 588.4 billion rupees ($7 billion) in gross profits from trading Indian equity derivatives, a study by the nation’s market regulator showed. Most Read from Bloomberg Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport The bulk of the gains came at the expense of individual traders and others, who lost a combined 610 billion rupees dabbling in stock futures and options in the financial year ended March, according to the study published Monday. The findings align with the Securities & Exchange Board of India’s push to slow the growth of the derivatives segment, whose turnover has skyrocketed over 40-fold since 2019, reaching a record $6 trillion in February — surpassing the size of India’s economy. SEBI has repeatedly cautioned small investors that they are taking a big risk in trying to bet against better-funded and more experienced financial market players. “There is little scope for individual traders to beat a mathematically-written model,” said Karthick Jonagadla, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based Quantace Research and Capital Pvt. “Trading equity options is altogether a different beast and chances of having a reward-to-risk ratio in your favor are minuscule.” India’s derivatives market grabbed global attention in April after US-based Jane Street Group revealed that a strategy used in the country generated $1 billion in profits. The revelation also shed light on how smaller investors are often at the wrong end of the trade. Nine out of every 10 retail derivatives traders lost money during the three-year period ended March, with the average loss per trader at about 200,000 rupees, SEBI’s latest study showed. Only 1% of traders made profits of over 100,000 rupees. More than 75% of the 10 million individual traders in India declared annual income of less than 500,000 rupees. A large part of the growth in India’s derivatives market was fueled by the start of weekly-expiring contracts in 2019, which replaced the traditional month-end expirations. These shorter-duration options stoked volumes, benefiting the National Stock Exchange of India, which has over 90% market share, and stock brokers.

Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Advertisement Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit , writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig.

The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Advertisement Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again.

The Other Bubble Log in Subscribe The Other Bubble Edward Zitron Sep 26, 2024 31 min read Buried in the 8000 words I wrote last week was a worrying story — that Microsoft considered drastic measures to free up capacity in its US-based servers for GPUs to power the AI boom. In an email shared with me by a source from earlier this year, Microsoft's senior leadership team requested (in a plan that was eventually scrapped) reducing power requirements from multiple areas within the company as a means of freeing up power for GPUs, including moving other services' compute to other countries as a means of freeing up capacity for AI. While it's hard to imagine, I want you to consider for a second that no company is invulnerable, and as I wrote last week, I have serious worries about the current state of Big Tech and the path it’s currently on. My last newsletter focused heavily on the ramifications of big tech — primarily Google, Amazon and Microsoft — bankrolling the generative AI boom, both through investment and by heavily subsidizing the rates that OpenAI (and likely Anthropic) pay to run their services, and through pouring billions of dollars of venture capital into AI companies. What I didn't get into as much depth about was the why — why these companies are so desperate to put generative AI in everything, and how doing so might be genuinely dangerous to their future. Because, let’s face it, every generative AI product we’ve seen from Big Tech has been underwhelming. They, for the most part, boil down to offering summaries of stuff, finding stuff, or putting a chatbot (which they call an "agent") on stuff, which can, in turn, find you stuff. Sometimes, when they're feeling spicy, a service can help you search for stuff in your organization too, then summarize that, or even come to conclusions based on it, which will be generated using generative AI, which hallucinates.However, to really explain, I need to tell you about how a large chunk of the tech industry makes money, and how the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy thinking makes the software you use in the workplace so much worse. I need you to understand that while companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are the more public faces of generative AI, and consumer-facing tools like ChatGPT are the PR vehicles that catapulted them into relevance, the actual revenue — the real dollars — that have underpinned almost every hyper-growth market have come from finding a way to sell it at a monthly cost to the enterprise. Hey Ed, what about all the discord at OpenAI? Mira Murati (their CTO) left, along with two other execs! I will get to it next week. In fact, maybe it's worth considering the enterprise as the commercial real estate of the tech industry . And yes, it's time to start getting worried. Software As A Disservice Forgive me, I am about to explain something that seems quite niche, but actually affects a remarkably large part of your life. Core to the business models of multiple tech companies is the humble "SaaS" (software as a service) model, where you're charged a monthly amount on a per-user basis for some sort of cloud-based software that you neither own nor control. To be clear, there's nothing inherently wrong with SaaS. For businesses, it reduces costs by removing the need to run their own infrastructure and employ people to maintain it. It can run theoretically from anywhere and costs are measurable, predictable, and adaptable to the organization's size. And, crucially, businesses don’t have to pay upfront for a license — which can cost thousands, or tens of thousands — and spread the cost across the life of the application. You can see the appeal. SaaS is one of the most dominant business models in tech, because it fits both the customer profile of "not wanting to run a bunch of infrastructure" and the tech industry's love of trapping people in distinct ecosystems that are hard to escape. While SaaS is generally a good deal for small-to-mid-sized companies, the inevitable sprawl of letting SaaS into your organization means that you're stuck with them. While managing 100 accounts might be something that your organization can do alone, how are you going to manage 1000? Or 10,000? Managing SaaS applications is a time-consuming and tedious process for large businesses, and now there are even — you guessed it — SaaS applications that can do it for you . What happens if your organization is in Europe and needs to be GDPR-compliant? What happens if you need to make sure your data is held on a server entirely separate to the rest of the company's business? While some SaaS companies offer private cloud (where the application exists on its own dedicated AWS or Azure instance), giving companies the flexibility to choose where and how to store their data, many don’t. This is the devil's deal of the three-trillion-dollar Software-As-A-Service market ( and SaaS spend is expected to crest over $230 billion in 2024 ). While the convenience of not having to build your own distinct software run on its own distinct hardware is great , or having to pay ungodly sums upfront for software licenses, you are also effectively outsourcing your entire organization's functionality to another company. With every new integration, every new seat, every new add-on their sales team makes you pay for and every new product they graciously train your staff to use, your organization becomes more burdened by the beast of SaaS. The bigger you are — or the longer you stay — the more powerful the parasite becomes, eventually burdening your organization to the point that you are effectively only as innovative as the SaaS provider you're anchored to. As an aside, "SaaS" and "cloud" kind of get mashed together sometimes because the whole idea of cloud computing is that you run stuff on other companies' computers, meaning that you have to rent it from them. This is tech's rent-seeking arm, and business was, for a while, booming. Also, the reason I'm so focused on the sale of cloud software is that compute can, at times, be a smokescreen. As organizations build their own AI integrations — through either paying for compute for their own purpose-built solutions or by integrating OpenAI's GPT — there is likely to be some revenue growth in cloud providers. That being said, we're yet to see this actually happen, outside of OpenAI's alleged $3.4 billion of yearly revenue (it still loses $5 billion a year), and generative AI's multi-billion dollar contribution to Amazon Web Services revenue over an indeterminate amount of time. I'm telling you all of this is because it's the answer to why whatever business you're working for has such shitty, shitty software. Not only is it inherently difficult to switch providers (because there's basically no incentive for them to help, and no legal imperative that forces them to), but SaaS companies have built entire ecosystems — like developers that cost six figures that develop just for Salesforce and entire companies that exist to sell other companies' (like Microsoft)'s software — specifically to make sure that anybody scaling a business inevitably ends up using their software. Almost every major SaaS company offers some kind of developer program, which in turn creates an entire cottage industry of people who exist entirely to help monopolies extend themselves. The reason that so many "channel partners" (the organizations built entirely to sell software from Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and other cloud companies) exist is because they handle the smaller, less-profitable (yet just as time consuming) markets, allowing big cloud companies to hire hundreds of thousands of sales people (or the organizations they work for) entirely on commission. They also make money — though not as much — by selling a variety of managed services. Microsoft's Unified Enterprise plan offers round-the-clock support at a percentage of your annual spend , and while there's nothing wrong per se with offering specialized, tailored support, it's also important to realize that this support is not something that exists as a means of Microsoft making money, but a means of increasing your sunk cost with Redmond. The goal of these programs, as I've suggested, is to anchor you to an ecosystem. The more money you spend — hiring developers to code specifically for one platform, paying for specialized support from one platform, adding users and add-ons and storing data and doing stuff on a system — the more costly it becomes to leave, and said cost becomes only more burdensome the larger your organization becomes. While not all Software-As-A-Service companies are parasites, the incentive for these companies is less about serving your needs and more about making sure they're so deeply embedded in your organization that they're impossible to remove. In 2011, Marc Andreessen said that “ software is eating the world.” And he was right. How does this manifest in your daily life? Well, have you ever used a piece of software at a company you work for that sucks? Was it sold by Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Atlassian or another big SaaS company? Well, it was probably bought by somebody who doesn't use the software, and it'll cost far more to remove than your annoyance matters. The burdensome presence of software like Microsoft Teams or Salesforce Platform in your life is a result of these organizations using brand recognition to sell into your organization, and once they're in there, their sales teams exist to continually find ways to increase the revenue of each user. The people making the decisions about the software you use — usually C-level executives — are doing so based on a sales pitch tailored to them and their preconceptions of what your job is rather than any firm experience, and thus they will sign year(s) long contracts based on a great sales pitch and the financials that "make sense." As a result, software from companies like Microsoft and Salesforce only has to be good enough to fool the purchaser, and perhaps a few troublesome "users" that might get trotted into negotiation where both parties may or may not have already agreed it's happening. The classic adage "Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" is how big SaaS companies make their money, and once they've got you, it's so very, very difficult to make them leave, because the cries of agony about their questionable software come from people altogether separate from those making the decisions. In fact, a great deal of software decision-making appears to be made entirely for show. Take Microsoft PowerBI, which Nik Suresh (who you might remember from the excellent " I Will Fucking Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again ") calls " A Human Rights Violation ." PowerBI is a "business intelligence platform" sold as part of a $54.75-a-head-a-month software package (with an annual commit) that helps you create dashboards of data from your organization that you can, I assume, make judgments based on, or as Suresh puts it, something you "connect [to] spreadsheets, then you drag charts onto a page, and it makes graphs that [he] can't even describe as pretty." Suresh found, in the organization he was working in, that dashboards were barely-viewed, and worse-still didn't auto-refresh , meaning that most people viewed the data and didn't actually see if it was recent, or relevant, or useful. The thing is, PowerBI doesn't exist so that you like it or that it's useful , but so that you pay Microsoft a monthly fee and don't pay Salesforce a monthly fee to use Tableau, which offers "the world's broadest, deepest analytics platform" for the low, low (starting) price of — and this is for the regular version of Tableau — $15 a user a month, at an annual commitment, and that user can only view stuff, you're gonna need to pay $75 a user a month if you want to do everything with Tableau. As a result, it's just cheaper to use Microsoft's faux-Tableau no matter how hard it Tablows, because it's part of a bunch of other apps that you need like Word, PowerPoint, and Sharepoint, an "enterprise content management platform" that everybody hates that allows you to build internal documents and host files in a way that makes it near-impossible to share anything outside of your organization. But what're you gonna do? Pay for a whole other thing when Microsoft has you by the balls? You stupid asshole. Get out of my office. The reason I'm drawing such a vast, ungainly picture of the SaaS market is because behind every single stupid workplace application you're subjected to is the parasitic existence of big tech's SaaS parasite. Whatever organization that's burdened you with some sort of half-baked, half-useful piece of shit business app has done so because the people up top don't care if it's good, just that it works, and "works" can be an extremely fuzzy word. It doesn't matter that Microsoft Teams is universally-loathed and regularly threatens to crash every time you load it . A Microsoft salesperson used its monopoly power to cut your boss a deal to either bundle it with a bunch of other mediocre shit or they saw the name "Microsoft" and said "oh boy! I love Microsoft Word!" and pulled out their credit card so fast it left a gouge in their monitor. If you're wondering why Zoom has remained the same rat king of mediocre software and labyrinthine settings, it's for the same reason — while its business might be serving this software, it's never really sold to the people who have the misfortune of using it regularly or having to administer it. This problem only compounds in the public sector, where tech integrations are bought by people who don't use them, and the only thing more languid than a sales cycle is an organization's ability to change. The same goes for banks, or any other highly-regulated space, because said services have to be so customized and cost so much both in time and dollars invested, especially with the vast amounts of reporting and data access controls required in anything touching financial or medical data. Not to worry, big tech's software parasites have entire arms dedicated to these expensive specialized solutions , and can provide them across a number of different mediocre apps that nevertheless make it easier to stay compliant, making it borderline-impossible for smaller companies to compete. On top of that, SaaS pricing is intentionally vague, and gets more so the larger and more demanding your organization's needs are. While it might say something is $50-a-month-per-head, perhaps you need to make sure data stays in America, or that you have extra storage, or special permissions for some users, or you need some users to access some apps and not others. All of these start costing money in a way that is impossible for you, the customer, to calculate, but will magically seem to increase every year. Your business software will stay the same level of mediocre because it doesn't have to get any better. The SaaS parasite gets fatter and harder to move the larger you get, trading the convenience of having the software "all under one roof" for a product that you'd actually like. To be clear, I'm not saying any of this precludes you from buying other software, and in fact products like Microsoft 365 (Redmond’s rat king of software options) will somewhat plug into other services...assuming you can work out how. Perhaps you can use something like Zapier , a piece of software that exists to automate actions between your massive stack of software you own for some reason, because said software doesn't actually do what you need it to do, and is rarely built to be interoperable (as in having its data easily operated on by another piece of software), because making software interoperable would allow you to leave. The reason I've spent so much energy explaining this is because I want you to know why so much business software fucking sucks . If you're reading this, I'd put the likelihood that your company (or a partner) makes you use some sort of janky, horrible

This $45 billion market has become increasingly popular because of favorable financial market conditions leading to pension surpluses. In 2023 alone, 773 corporate pensions pursued PRTs, including major first-timers like Verizon and Shell USA. Bloomberg Law 5-14-24 based on Aon plc survey Photo: Aon plc Last year, the US Department of Labor (DOL) reported it was revisiting guidelines that could lead to regulatory changes and heightened scrutiny of the PRT process. Specific focus was on proposed updates to a 1995 Interpretive Bulletin (IB 95-1) that provides guidance on how defined benefit plan fiduciaries should select insurance companies for these transactions. Under the guidelines, pension plans are instructed to prioritize the “safest available annuity” when choosing an insurer. In June 2024, the DOL released its long-awaited report on Interpretive Bulletin 95-1. The report summarized discussions with stakeholders and concluded that the DOL is not currently proposing amendments to the bulletin, though the topic is not closed to further discussion. However, PRT continues to raise concerns among large employers, retirees and other industry stakeholders. Some viewpoints from the major constituencies include: Life insurers fear that any change in the Labor Department’s stance could have a chilling effect on the PRT market, discouraging employers from offloading their pension liabilities. Pension advocacy groups opt for greater regulatory clarity to protect the safety of pension obligations, as evidenced by recent lawsuits against companies like AT&T, Alcoa, and Lockheed Martin. These lawsuits allege that pension plan sponsors violated their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by selecting risky annuity providers. Further, The Pension Rights Center and National Retiree Legislative Network have both raised concerns about how widespread the practice of pension risk transfers has become. Karen Friedman, PRC’s executive director - “Plan participants lose a lot in these transactions—including valuable [Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation] insurance and other ERISA rights.” And NRLN’s president Bill Kadereit goes further in saying “There is no financial genius to dissolving liabilities you chose not to honor, nothing entrepreneurial and nothing to brag about to investors.” In particular, many lawsuits filed by workers have challenged de-risking transactions with Athene Holding , an insurance subsidiary of Apollo, the private equity firm. Critics argue plan sponsors derisking with Athene are choosing an annuity provider connected to a private equity firm with a higher risk structure than a traditional life insurance company. Many in the retirement and insurance communities are wary of significant changes to the existing framework, as PRTs have become a common mechanism for defined benefit plans. And some industry representatives, like those from the American Council of Life Insurers, are calling for a more transparent rule-making process that would allow for public feedback.

Insurance stakeholders remain concerned that the DOL will augment regulations, while retirement stakeholders fear a weakening of retiree pension safety. Follow me on LinkedIn .

TRANSCRIPT [ Music: You can go the distance, we’ll find out, in the long run ] Barry Ritholtz : Stocks have outperformed every other asset class over the long run, assuming you measure the long run at about 20 plus years, real estate, gold bonds. It’s hard to find anything that has a track record as good as equities since the late 19th century. The challenge? Stocks can be risky, even volatile, over long periods of time, and there are so many different approaches to investing that it can get confusing. But as it turns out, there are some ways you can take advantage of equities as an asset class that work well if you’re a long term investor. I’m Barry Ritholtz, and on today’s At The Money, we’re going to discuss how to use equities in your portfolio for the long run. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your investing, let’s bring in Jeremy Schwartz. He’s the Global Chief Investment Officer at Wisdom Tree Asset Management and the longtime collaborator with Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel, whose book, Stocks for the Long Run, has become an investing classic. So Jeremy, let’s start with the basics. What does the historical data say about stocks? Jeremy Schwartz : Well, your intro hit it exactly perfectly. It has been the best long-term return vehicle. Now, you know, today’s a time we’re all thinking about inflation. We’ve had very high inflation. And this is where people say, well, does inflation change the case for stocks? And, you know, is, is higher inflation a risk to stocks thesis? And we say, you know, stocks are not just a good hedge. for inflation. They’re the best hedge for inflation. Barry Ritholtz : Right? If revenue goes up, if profits go up, stock prices are going to go up. Jeremy Schwartz : Yeah, over the very long term, you see stocks have done, in Siegel’s data, he had this 200 years plus of returns across stocks, bonds, bills, gold, the dollar. You had 6/5 to 7% over all long-term time periods, above inflation, okay? And that was a stable return. We could talk about factors that change that looking forward. But, you know, six, seven above inflation with a pretty smooth line. Nothing had that same stability of constant real returns over time. Barry Ritholtz : So we’re talking about the long run. How do you define the long run? What is the sort of holding period that investors should think about if they want to get all of those benefits? Jeremy Schwartz : We, we tend to think of 7 to 10 years as a good forward-looking indicator. There are periods where stocks can go down. The, the longest period we had in our data was 17 years of losses of purchasing power, so after inflation, purchasing power. Barry Ritholtz : 1966-82 or was it earlier than that? Jeremy Schwartz : Yeah, and that was exactly around that time. And, you know, bonds had a double that time period, so they had a thirty-five-year period, where it had negative real returns. You didn’t have TIPS bonds back in the day. TIPS are Treasury Inflation Protective Securities that get an adjustment for inflation, so the primary risk to bonds was that inflationary period. But you actually had negative. Tips yields not so long ago. Um, just before this recent increase in rates 18 months ago, you had negative yields, you know, Barry Ritholtz : So if I’m a long-term investor, if I’m gonna hold on to my portfolio for 10 or even better 20 years. What are the best strategies to use to capture those returns? Jeremy Schwartz : You know, we do believe very much in diversification, owning the full market. It is very tough to pick the individual stocks. When we talk about stocks for long run, you can have long-term losers. But when you buy a broad market portfolio, You’re getting that diversification. The winners tend to rise to the top over time. It renews all the time. And, owning the market cheaply, you can do that now much more than ever before, which is one of the reasons why you could pay more for the market than you did historically. It was much harder to get diversification than you can today. Barry Ritholtz : So we’ve talked about 66-82, 2000-2013, equities did poorly. More recently. The first quarter of 2020 and then pretty much all of 2022, stocks did poorly. What should investors do when equities are in a bear market? Jeremy Schwartz : Often when you’re in a bear market, it’s a good time to be thinking about adding to allocations versus selling from allocations. You got to think about The real long term probability of when do you lose? We often look at stocks versus T bills just as a simple way of doing that. And two thirds of the time, stocks do better than cash. You know, one third of the time, you’ll have stocks losing to cash. Uh, you know, the cash today is 5%. So people say, is that now a time to be thinking about those cash rates? But when you zoom out, you go from one year to five years, the odds of success for stocks go up to 75%. You zoom out to 10 years, it’s like 85%. And 20 years. It’s 99% of the time to stocks. [Just about always]. Almost always. So, we, we do say, look at the long term. Yes, you can have painful periods, but you got to think back to that long term opportunity of stocks versus cash. Barry Ritholtz : So, let’s talk about volatility and drawdowns. People tend to get nervous when the market is in the red. What do you think about dollar cost averaging or other approaches when stocks are in what might be a 3, a 5, a 7-year bear market? Jeremy Schwartz : If we’re coming off the holiday season, we had the Black Friday sales, Cyber Monday sales. You see prices go down, you get excited and you go buy. That’s really what you need to think about with stocks. They go on sale and you want to take the opportunity to buy. You don’t want to be selling at those very. panic-type sales. One of Professor Siegel’s good friends, Bob Schiller, wrote “ Irrational Exuberance; ” You get to these periods of irrational dis-exuberance where people get overly pessimistic about what’s ahead, and those are the times to be thinking about adding to your portfolio. Barry Ritholtz : We were talking about this in the office, especially for younger people, under 40, under 30, when markets pull back, they shouldn’t be dour about it. They have a 30 or a 40-year investment horizon. If you’re young and markets are in a sell off, shouldn’t you be more aggressive at that point, buying more equities? Jeremy Schwartz : Oh, for sure. I mean, it’s hard in that moment. You see the prices going down, and you’re, you start thinking the world’s gonna end, and people panic react, but that is the time when we think you should be adding. Barry Ritholtz : So what about other periods where we see equities underperforming a specific asset class, precious metals, or gold? How should an investor be thinking about that? Jeremy Schwartz : Gold has been one of those ideas of it’s an inflation hedge. It has kept up in Siegel’s 200 years of data. It has kept up with inflation, but delivered less than 1% a year over the last 200 years. So it’s been a good inflation hedge. It kept up, but not much more when stocks did 6% on top of inflation. So I think the, the hardest challenge is you can say, yes, I’m worried about inflation, gold, something to look at. We’ve done some things that wisdom tree looking at capital efficient investing, where we stack like gold on top of stocks, where you can get both of them without having to sell your stocks to buy gold. I think that’s one of the ways to think about gold. But over very long-term periods, stocks have been, you know, better long term accumulations of wealth. Barry Ritholtz : How should investors think about black swans? Events like the pandemic or the great financial crisis. What should they be doing during these panicky sell-offs? Jeremy Schwartz : Risk always exists. We’ve been living with these types of risks throughout all of time. They do seem to be more presence in our minds today. Even just the recent Hamas attack on Israel, has you worried about what’s going to happen around the world? And are they going to bring it to the U. S.? And all sorts of questions. These things always are there. They’re in the background. But that’s one of the things that gives stocks a risk premium. They’re premium returns because they have risk. If you didn’t to have risk of just being T bills, then you don’t get compensated for that risk that you’re taking. Barry Ritholtz : You mentioned Professor Bob Schiller, who’s done a lot of work with expected returns. How should investors think about equities when valuations are a little elevated? Jeremy Schwartz : It’s absolutely true. Stocks are more expensive than their history. But it’s also true, that bonds are more expensive than their history. So people say, again, I get 5% in risk-free treasuries. Should that lower the case for stocks? That’s the short-term rate. Um, you know, you got to look at tips, yields, tips are those inflation-protected securities, the 10-year tips are right around 2% today. You look at stocks, P’s below 20 called 18 to 19 forward PEs. That’s giving you a five to 6% earnings yield. So the equity premium of stocks versus tips is above 3%, which is exactly the same as Siegel’s 200 years of data. There was a 3$ equity premium. It was around three and a half a percent for bonds, a little bit over six and a half for stocks. Today, bonds are 2. You’re getting more than 5 in stocks, if we look again, seven to ten years out. And so they’re not expensive by historical standards on an equity premium basis over stocks versus bonds. And so, yes, they’re both lower than their 200-year data, but it’s a reasonable equity risk premium today. Barry Ritholtz : So what are the biggest challenges to staying invested for the long run? Jeremy Schwartz : It is really that short-term volatility and the sort of panic moments of all sorts of these risks that come up last few years has been fed in inflation. Now it’s geopolitics. I think it’s gonna be more about geopolitics over the next 12 months. And it is the Fed. The Fed, we think, is sort of rearview mirror and they’re on their way towards loosening policy. It’s now all about what’s happening on the world stage. But that’s noise in the short run that will create a lot of volatility. But over the long run, you look at that long-term compounding of 6% real after inflation returns is what we come back to. Barry Ritholtz : So to wrap up, investors who have a long-term time horizon, and let’s define that as better 20 years should own a diversified portfolio of equities. The caveat, they should expect volatility in the occasional drawdown, even a market crash now and again. It’s all part of the process. Long-term investors understand that they get paid to hold equities through uncomfortable periods. If it was easy, Everybody would be rich. You can listen to At The Money every week.

How stocks can roar by 10% into year-end, Citi US equity-trading head says Read full article Filip De Mott Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 2:09 AM 2 min read Link Copied 1 Business Insider The stock market could jump as much as 10% by the year-end, Citi's stock-trading strategy head said. Stuart Kaiser told Bloomberg TV that the uber-bull case is now "a plausible scenario." He said the economy only needs to avoid a recession, which will ultimately depend on the labor market. Wall Street is forecasting S&P 500 highs that reach past the 6,000 threshold . This bullishness may be well earned, Citi's Stuart Kaiser said. "The uber-bull case, I think, for all of this year has been: you avoid a recession, you get insurance cuts, right? And that is now a plausible scenario," the firm's head of US equity-trading strategy told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. If this is achieved, stocks can surge another 5% to 10% by the end of this year, Kaiser said. So far, the second half of those conditions have been met. This month, the Federal Reserve finally started reducing interest rates, in a move meant to prevent a future economic slump. This precautionary "insurance" cut — amounting to a 50-basis-point reduction to the federal funds rate — was embraced by stock investors, and indexes have since notched new record highs. To Kaiser's point, this will continue as long as a recession does not materialize. But though the Fed emphasized that it was not forecasting a looming downturn during its latest policy meeting, it all hinges on incoming labor market data, he noted. Since August, slipping employment conditions have been the core driver of slowdown fears. Investors will need to see labor figures remain intact in upcoming monthly data, or else recession outlooks could become increasingly valid. "Our view is risk reward is tough because it's really dependent on month-to-month," Kaiser noted, warning that recessionary prints would easily upend any Fed efforts to support the market. Other banks are also eyeing jobs data . According to Morgan Stanley, investors can celebrate if unemployment falls below 4.1% and non-farm payrolls reach over 150,000. This will be the best-case scenario for the market , keeping momentum going. Otherwise, trading should prepare for the worst if unemployment climbs above 4.3% and payrolls slide under 100,000. "The Fed puts not going to protect you if you get that kind of data, and that's why we think the risk reward is kind of a little bit off right now," Kaiser said.

Following Sep 26, 2024, 10:45am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Chinese stocks surged Thursday as investors responded favorably to Beijing’s commitment to jolt its economy, with New York-listed shares of the firms adding hundreds of billions of dollars, helping boost American stocks as well. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange prior to Alibaba Group's initial price ... [+] offering in 2014. Getty Images Key Facts The 20 largest Chinese companies dually listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq tacked on $71 billion of market capitalization in the U.S., led by the more than $15 billion respective rallies from e-commerce giants Alibaba and Pinduoduo. The 20 stocks gained an average of 11% in New York by about 10:15 a.m. EDT, according to Yahoo Finance data. That helped boost the Nasdaq Composite tech stock index 1% to a two-month high; the U.S.’ other leading stock indexes, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, rose a more modest 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively partially tied to the fact the dual-listed Chinese stocks only factor into the Nasdaq. The stateside gains followed massive gains in Asian trading for Chinese companies, as China’s CSI 300 index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index tacked on about 4% apiece. The rally stems from the latest indications the Chinese government is willing to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars worth of economic stimulus and a Bloomberg report that the government is weighing a massive $142 billion capital injection into state-run banks, all building on China’s central bank announcing Wednesday it was lowering interest rates by its steepest amount ever. The last week has been a “whole shift” from the Chinese government as it brings out the “big guns” policy-wise to support growth, hedge fund billionaire David Tepper told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday morning, adding he’s buying “everything” he can get his hands on tied to Chinese equities. Surprising Fact This week is on pace to be the best week for the CSI 300, which is up 10.8%, since Dec. 2014, and for the Hang Seng, which is up 9.1%, since Oct. 2011. The “compelling” backdrop for a “tactical recovery” came as new money flowed in following the weakest hedge fund allocation to Chinese stocks in a decade, noted Goldman Sachs analyst Kinger Lau in a Wednesday note to clients. Crucial Quote “This could be a game changer” for Chinese stocks, Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investor officer, Americas, wrote to clients Thursday, though she noted risks from aggressive U.S. tariffs should former President Donald Trump win the presidency in November. Key Background The 20 largest Chinese stocks used in the market value calculations are according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s Jan. 2024 compilation . Despite this week’s explosive rally, Chinese stocks are mired in an extended slump as the country’s economy struggles to return to its pre-pandemic expansion rate. The CSI 300 has provided a 6% return to investors year-to-date and a -21% return over the last three years, far underperforming the S&P’s 21% year-to-date and 35% three-year returns. U.S. trading of Chinese stocks involves the exchange of American depositary receipts, which entitle investors to equity in Chinese firms without direct ownership. Tangent European luxury stocks, which were badly battered by diminished demand in China, soared Thursday as the market adjusted to optimism about a Chinese recovery. Shares of French firms LVMH, Hermès and Dior rose 9% apiece in Paris trading. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Send me a secure tip .

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Sep 25, 2024, 10:59am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Key News Asian equities were mixed overnight as Mainland China outperformed and South Korea underperformed. Hong Kong and Mainland China opened higher after yesterday’s monetary policy bazooka. Still, they faded across the trading day, though both managed to post gains, especially the latter, on very higher volumes of 244% and 148% of the 1-year average, respectively. Skeptics are pointing to the lack of fiscal policy support, though yesterday’s monetary policy moves were completely unexpected and took investors by complete surprise. A bank reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut of 0.50% with another 0.25% to 0.50% wasn’t a shock, but we also had the 7-day reverse repo rate cut by 0.20%, which led to the loan prime rate (LPR) and deposit rates declining by 0.20%. We also had the mortgage rate reduced by 0.50%, a minimum down payment ratio reduced to 15% from 25%, and RMB 300 billion dedicated to support affordable housing. Overnight, the medium-term lending facility rate was reduced to 2% from 2.30%. What shocked investors the most was the RMB 500 billion fund dedicated to supporting the Mainland equity market investments, which could be increased if necessary, and RMB 300 billion to support corporate buybacks, which is unprecedented. Overnight, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced it would look to reform the mergers and acquisitions rules of listed companies. After the close, the State Council announced it would look at “implementing an employment priority strategy to promote high-quality full employment,” especially for college graduates. How this would occur was a bit opaque, less a focus on vocational skills training, though we can assume more policy will be coming. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor All sectors were positive in Mainland China as Northbound Stock Connect volumes were very high, indicating that overseas money came back into Mainland stocks. Did money come out of Japan and South Korea and back into "cheap" China? It is difficult to know. Mainland money came out of Hong Kong via Southbound Stock Connect with -$690 million of net selling, as Tencent and Meituan were net sells, though Alibaba had $336 million worth of net buying. Is Mainland money coming out of Hong Kong and going back into China a concern? No, because global investors are exceedingly underweight, with the rally coming a month/quarter end problematic for managers who have to disclose their holdings. Hong Kong growth stocks are where foreign investors will gravitate in my opinion, in addition to internet names that are actually growing fundamentally, unlike most of MSCI China. One factor in today’s fade-off of the highs is starting next Tuesday. Mainland China is closed for a week due to the National holiday. I would suspect an element of Hong Kong selling from the Mainland as profit-taking prior to the holiday from Mainland investors might occur. Hong Kong is only closed next Tuesday. Regardless, the dragon is awakening! The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +0.68% and +0.23%, respectively, on volume that increased+5% from yesterday, which is 244% of the 1-year average. 286 stocks advanced, while 194 declined. Main Board short turnover fell by -1.95% from yesterday, which is 270% of the 1-year average, as 19% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The value factor and large capitalization stocks outpaced growth and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Financials, up +2.28%, Energy, up +1.49%, and Materials, up +1.17%, while Information Technology fell -2.07% and Real Estate fell -0.93%. The top-performing subsectors included media, insurance, and capital goods. Meanwhile, technical hardware, food & beverage, and consumer services were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were very high as Mainland investors sold a net -$690 million of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy, Kuaishou, which was a small net buy, and Tencent and Meituan, which were large net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +1.16%, +1.24%, and +0.04%, respectively, on volume that increased +19% from yesterday, which is 148% of the 1-year average. 4,257 stocks advanced, while 727 stocks declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outpaced the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. All sectors were positive, led by industrials, which gained +2.19%, Financials, which gained +2.11%, and Communication Services, up +1.82%. The top-performing subsectors were diversified financials, construction, and heavy machinery. Meanwhile, oil & gas and computer hardware were among just a few negative subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were very high. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index gained versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds rallied. Copper and steel gained.

A New Definition For Equity In Education Skip to content 1.2k Views Facebook Twitter Equity In Education: A Definition by Terry Heick In a profession increasingly full of angst and positioning and corrective policy, there are few ideas as easy to get behind as equity. Equal. Equality. Equity. Equilibrium. Equate. These are all fine ideas—each tidy and whole, implying their own kind of justice while connotating the precision of mathematics. Level. Same. Twin. Each word has its own nuance, but one characteristic they share in common is access—a level, shared area with open pathways that are equidistant to mutually agreed-upon currencies. When discussing equity, there are so many convenient handles–race, gender, language, poverty, access to technology, but there may be a larger view that we’re missing when we do so. Equity is the idea and goal of fairness and inclusion to provi de all students with the resources, opportunities, and support they need to succeed, regardless of their background, abilities, or socioeconomic status. Unlike equality, which treats everyone the same, equity recognizes that students come from diverse circumstances and may require different approaches and resources to achieve similar outcomes. The Scale of Equity There isn’t a more global issue—equity being perhaps the global issue of our time. United Nation statistics published last year in The Economist put it plainly. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels. And elsewhere, in Chad and the Central African Republic, there is a flat-rate of less than 70 girls for every 100 boys.” This is a starkly different conversation about equity than the one we might have in the United States, the UK, Canada, or Australia. We have the luxury of becoming choosier, and harsher on ourselves, as progress is made, i.e., let’s first make sure there are free, quality schools everywhere, and that children can all read and write, and then at some point down the line we can concern ourselves with iPads vs Androids, or the broadband access in our poorest communities. It’s easy to miss the scale of this as an ‘issue’ because unlike assessment, curriculum, teacher pay, class sizes, educational technology, or any other persistently evergreen edu-choke point, equity never stops affecting. It’s both the center and periphery of everything because we’re always who we are, where we are. The Cultural Effect As a species, we express ourselves through differences. What makes ‘culture’ interesting is how it both recognizes the individual while simultaneously allowing them to disappear into the whole again. In culture, there is both identity and anonymity. There is a constant self–>group transaction that is based on both affection (inward expression) and image (outward expression). This transaction is then repeated across cultures, with completely different functions. Differences within and across cultures are differences nonetheless, but the individual can think while groups simply gather. So this is a brutally narrow take on how people gather and cohort and manifest their vision of what it means to be human, but the point remains: As educators, we suffer that same reductionism when we see the masses the same way Nielsen does television ratings. Students aren’t demographics, and it’s murky at best to see how treating them that way has improved their lot or our shared progress. While squinting and trying to narrow gaps, it’s too easy to lose the scale and product of our work. The segmenting of Mackenzie and Andrew into a group, and that group into a subgroup, and their understanding into data, and the knowledge we hope they come away with into standards we can teach with—this all becomes a tone—a posture dictates the terms of teaching and learning. Equity in the classroom is different than in the job market. A subcorollary is that we all share equity and inequity, both in possession and effect. In “The Hidden Wound,” Wendell Berry writes, “It may be the most significant irony in our history that racism, by dividing the two races, has made them not separate but in a fundamental way inseparable, not independent but dependent on each other, incomplete without each other, each needing desperately to understand and make use of the experience of the other…. we are one body, and the division between us is the disease of one body, not of two.” This is both abstract and practical. We share both living space and social membership. Somehow, though, public education, more so than any other industry or profession, is expected to aggregate these inherent disparities while transcending them. Our task? Create a curriculum that provides a common language for knowledge without homogenizing the nuance of that knowledge Design learning models that are inherently inclusive regardless of access to technology Establish authentic functions for family members and communities who may speak a completely different language As individuals, we work to separate ourselves—as children, often based on image, and as adults, often based on income, where we choose to live, what we drive, the smartphone we carry, and what we choose to do “for a living.” But each of these expressions of who we are–gender, native language, race, sexuality, socioeconomic level, and so many others–are also opportunities for disparity all work to undermine the function of education. It’s easy to see equity in education as a matter of fairness, access, and inclusion, but that’s only the case if what’s being fairly accessed is a system of teaching and learning that is able to meet the needs of an increasingly global population—that means fluid, responsive, dynamic, neutral, and alive. For an industry that struggles to get every student reading on grade level, this may be a bit much. My gut reaction, then, is that this can only occur through the affectionate expression of the local—this student in this home in this community, with the school functioning as an extraordinary support system. The equity is at the student level rather than the demographic level because demographics only exist in paperwork. For every student, there is commonness and there is difference; there is what’s shared (i.e., student needing knowledge), and there is distinction (e.g., poor, rural, white, black, male, female). This never stops. We can revise our schools, curriculum, pedagogy, and technology until it is inclusive, fair, and accessible to every student, but that’s been an ongoing effort that may represent a kind of basement for our goals. But why not consider something more ambitious? New thinking about the terms and definitions of gender emphasize both the characteristics and the fluidity of any culture. If we insist on standardizing content, maybe we can avoid standardizing education. How many different answers are there to, “Why learn?” Fantastic! Let’s iterate ourselves until we can honor that. The work before us, then, may not be to level an academic playing field for which there is no straight, but rather to create new terms for why we learn, how, and where—and then change the expectation for what we do with what we know. Simply guaranteeing access and inclusion into a body of content-based is no longer sufficient if our goals stretch beyond academic. A modern definition for equity in education may be less about equal, fair, or even, and more about personalization–a body of knowledge, habits, and networks that help each student realize their own perfectly unique potential. As for a definition for equity in education? How about, “eye-level access to curriculum, education models, and learning spaces that depend entirely on the native interests, knowledge demands, and human affections of learners individually.” Or more briefly, “a fully-realized system of learning that starts and ends with the humanity of each student.” A New Definition For Equity In Education; adapted image attribution flickr user helpingting and skotit; About The Author Terrell Heick Founder & Director of TeachThought

Blackstone Sells Motel 6 To Oyo In $525M Deal, Adding 1,450 Hotels To Indian Giant's Portfolio Read full article AJ Fabino Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 1:15 PM 3 min read Link Copied 1 Blackstone Sells Motel 6 To Oyo In $525M Deal, Adding 1,450 Hotels To Indian Giant's Portfolio Blackstone, the private equity powerhouse, has agreed to sell Motel 6, the iconic American budget hotel chain, to Oyo, an Indian hotel operator, for $525 million in cash. The deal, reported by The Wall Street Journal, marks Oyo’s expansion in the U.S. market and the end of Blackstone’s decadelong ownership of the budget lodging brand. The transaction includes G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6 and its extended-stay offshoot, Studio 6. With the acquisition, Oyo will add roughly 1,450 hotels across 49 states and five Canadian provinces, boosting its presence in North America. Don't Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ? Motel 6, founded in 1962 in Santa Barbara, California, has been a fixture of American road trips for decades. The chain’s name originated from its affordable original $6-per-night rate. Under Blackstone’s ownership since 2012, the brand has seen much growth and profitability. Rob Harper, head of Blackstone Real Estate Asset Management Americas, highlighted the success of their investment, saying in a statement that it had “generated over $1 billion in profit” during their ownership period. Blackstone had initially acquired G6 Hospitality for $1.9 billion. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! For Oyo, which entered the U.S. market in 2019, the acquisition represents a major milestone in its expansion strategy. The company operates over 320 hotels across 35 states and aims to add about 250 more this year. In a statement, Gautam Swaroop, CEO of Oyo International, cited Motel 6’s strong brand recognition, financial profile and network in the U.S. "This acquisition is a significant milestone for a startup company like us to strengthen our international presence," Swaroop said in the statement. "Motel 6's strong brand recognition, financial profile and network in the U.S. combined with OYO's entrepreneurial spirit will be instrumental in charting a sustainable path forward for the company which will continue to operate as a separate entity." See Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100 . The India-based hotel operator, describing itself as a startup, has received backing from Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group. However, its rapid growth has not been without controversy, with some incidents in India raising questions about its business practices. Story continues According to the WSJ report, the deal is expected to close by the end of the year subject to customary closing conditions. Oyo plans to operate Motel 6 as a separate entity, maintaining the brand’s identity while leveraging its extensive network. The transaction points to the ongoing consolidation in the hotel industry. As budget-conscious travelers continue to seek affordable accommodations , combining Oyo’s technology-driven approach and Motel 6’s established brand could reshape the landscape of economy lodging in North America.

Trump’s $100,000 Watches Are the Most Tragic Celebrity Watch Yet | WIRED Skip to main content Security Politics Gear The Big Story Business Science Culture Ideas Merch Podcasts Video Newsletters Magazine Travel Steven Levy's Plaintext Column WIRED Classics from the Archive Events WIRED Insider WIRED Consulting Jobs Coupons Save this story Save Save this story Save Celebrities partnering with watch brands is nothing new. Sometimes a bona fide watch enthusiast like John Mayer partners with Audemars Piguet, or Ed Sheeran (owner of a unique Patek Philippe, no less) teams up with Casio. Then there's the other end of the scale, where controversial Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and his own watch company resides. Now, however, there’s a new nadir: the Trump Watch. Announced this week by former US president Donald Trump, the collection consists of two pieces. One is called “ Fight Fight Fight ” and is priced from $499, and the other is the “ Victory Tourbillon .” The latter is claimed to be made from solid 18-karat gold, with 122 diamonds and a tourbillon automatic movement. It’s priced at a nice, round $100,000—about three times the price of an equivalent Rolex Submariner —and, yes, crypto payment is available. The watches are claimed to feature “premium, Swiss-Made materials and intricate details,” but so far as we can tell, the Fight Fight Fight uses a movement by Japanese company Seiko, while the Victory Tourbillon has a movement alleged to be partially built from Chinese components. It gets better. In what quickly starts to resemble the tweet-riddled fever dreams of the extremely online, the watches are produced by a company called TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC, which is based in Sheridan, Wyoming, and, despite no watchmaking history to speak of, has a license agreement to use the Trump name for its timepieces. “We also accept Bitcoin as payment!”, the GetTrumpWatches website yells, as if handing over actual dollars to a company who admits the images of the timepieces “are for illustration purposes only” isn’t enough to raise an eyebrow. We’ll come back to the Tourbillon in a moment. For now, let's look at the cheaper of the two, called the Fighter. At least that’s what the website address suggests it’s called, but it’s also described as the “Fight Fight Fight Watch”—and in the description of the black and gold colorway it’s “The Fight Fight Fight Black Watch.” Either way, it resembles a Rolex Submariner described down a patchy phone line. But don’t just take our word for it. WIRED Watch expert Tim Barber told us: “Trump evidently has some cut-through among certain watch fans, since the gold sneakers he auctioned earlier this year were bought by Roman Sharf , one of the most prominent gray-market watch dealers, with a sizable YouTube following." (Incidentally, the companies that made the gold sneakers and the new Trump Watches were established by the same register agent, Andrew Pierce of Cloud Peak Law, Wyoming.)

As it happens, all-gold watches being very on trend in the luxury market at the moment, he joins Rolex in producing a gold dive watch this year. But I would be less confident of this sharing any other qualities with a Rolex.” Trump Watches says the timepiece “was made for those who combine boldness and elegance,” and that its gold accents “create a tasteful balance of color, perfect for a dress watch”—which is odd when you consider the fact this is quite clearly a dive watch. Trump's $500 dive/dress watches boast a screw-down case back which features an image of the former president after he narrowly escaped assassination, and an automatic movement that costs $55. Courtesy of TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC The screw-down case back features an image of Trump after he narrowly escaped assassination, along with his signature, plus a “200 meters” engraving. Strangely, all three variants of the Fight Fight Fight have the same waterproofing claim on their case back, but only the limited-edition $799 all-gold version states as much on its product page. The other two models, each priced at $499, state 200 meters on their cases, but contradict this with 100 meters of water resistance in their specifications. Perhaps consider removing your Fight Fight Fight before you go swimming.

The other two variants have just a date window and use the simpler NH35 movement. Both movements can be bought online from about $55 . Again, this seems completely at odds with claims on the Trump Watches website of “premium, Swiss-Made materials and intricate details.” The Trump Victory Tourbillons cost $100,000 and are limited to 147 pieces, but our watch expert says “these would suck as $50 mall watches.” Courtesy of TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC Now for the Tourbillon, the $100,000 flagship of the Trump watch collection. “This isn’t just any watch,” the former president said. “It’s one of the best watches made,” he adds without context. Limited to 147 pieces—although the website admits they’re made to order—the watch is offered with a solid gold case and dial, a gold case and black dial, or a rose gold case and dial. All three have the “Trump” name at the twelve o’clock position and a window revealing their tourbillon movement within. The watch is claimed to use a “TX07 Tourbillon” with 105 hours of power reserve, but finding any record of such a movement online is tricky. Watch commentator Nico Leonard van der Horst said in an Instagram post : “This is hilarious … the manufacturer of this movement is Olivier Mory, who ironically is known for making very affordable Tourbillons half made in China, half made in Switzerland.” Van der Horst added: “If you were to buy this movement and put it in your own watch, you would be able to buy it for under $3.5k.” Most Popular Gear This Talking Pet Collar Is Like a Chatbot for Your Dog By Boone Ashworth Gear A Rubberized Cybertruck Is Plowing Through European Pedestrian Safety Rules By Carlton Reid Gear The Best Fitness Trackers and Watches for Everyone By Adrienne So Gear The Best iPad to Buy (and a Few to Avoid) By Brenda Stolyar The movement is visible through an exhibition case back, which in marketing material from Trump Watches seemingly includes the personalized message from Trump “James, let’s think big!”, along with Trump’s signature. Bizarrely, the diamond-covered bezel appears to have grips around its circumference. These are usually only seen on rotating bezels, but since there are no markings on this bezel, there’s no reason for it to rotate, and thus no reason for the gripped design. “The watches are as tawdry, ill-designed, and generic as you’d expect, and look as though they’ve been assembled from leftover bits in the parts bin.” Courtesy of TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC Back to Barber for more informed analysis: “The watches are as tawdry, ill-designed, and generic as you’d expect, and look as though they’ve been assembled from leftover bits in the parts bin of whichever white label company was prepared to take Trump‘s dime. These would suck as $50 mall watches, let alone as a facsimile of luxury watchmaking. “Nevertheless, these monstrosities may not be the worst watches associated with Donald Trump. Back in 2019, Moritz Grossmann, a German firm specializing in high-end artisanal horology, saw fit to mark a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-Un with a commemorative limited edition. Although arguably even more brazen in its bad taste, at around €13,000, it probably offered rather better value for the workmanship involved.” The latest Trump watches are available to order now, if you really must, but the website states vaguely how shipping starts in “October/November/December.” Despite only accepting pre-orders at this stage, the seller warns “there are no refunds. All sales are final.” It adds: “Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments … We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive.” Most rarely find themselves in the market for a $100,000 watch, but WIRED imagines buyers generally seek more assurances on when their expensive purchases might arrive. The Trump Watches website says money spent on these watches does not go to Trump’s presidential campaign, adding: “Trump Watches are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” You Might Also Like … In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED’s archive Interview: Marissa Mayer is not a feminist.

The Other Bubble Log in Subscribe The Other Bubble Edward Zitron Sep 26, 2024 31 min read Buried in the 8000 words I wrote last week was a worrying story — that Microsoft considered drastic measures to free up capacity in its US-based servers for GPUs to power the AI boom. In an email shared with me by a source from earlier this year, Microsoft's senior leadership team requested (in a plan that was eventually scrapped) reducing power requirements from multiple areas within the company as a means of freeing up power for GPUs, including moving other services' compute to other countries as a means of freeing up capacity for AI. While it's hard to imagine, I want you to consider for a second that no company is invulnerable, and as I wrote last week, I have serious worries about the current state of Big Tech and the path it’s currently on. My last newsletter focused heavily on the ramifications of big tech — primarily Google, Amazon and Microsoft — bankrolling the generative AI boom, both through investment and by heavily subsidizing the rates that OpenAI (and likely Anthropic) pay to run their services, and through pouring billions of dollars of venture capital into AI companies. What I didn't get into as much depth about was the why — why these companies are so desperate to put generative AI in everything, and how doing so might be genuinely dangerous to their future. Because, let’s face it, every generative AI product we’ve seen from Big Tech has been underwhelming. They, for the most part, boil down to offering summaries of stuff, finding stuff, or putting a chatbot (which they call an "agent") on stuff, which can, in turn, find you stuff. Sometimes, when they're feeling spicy, a service can help you search for stuff in your organization too, then summarize that, or even come to conclusions based on it, which will be generated using generative AI, which hallucinates.However, to really explain, I need to tell you about how a large chunk of the tech industry makes money, and how the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy thinking makes the software you use in the workplace so much worse. I need you to understand that while companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are the more public faces of generative AI, and consumer-facing tools like ChatGPT are the PR vehicles that catapulted them into relevance, the actual revenue — the real dollars — that have underpinned almost every hyper-growth market have come from finding a way to sell it at a monthly cost to the enterprise. Hey Ed, what about all the discord at OpenAI? Mira Murati (their CTO) left, along with two other execs! I will get to it next week. In fact, maybe it's worth considering the enterprise as the commercial real estate of the tech industry . And yes, it's time to start getting worried. Software As A Disservice Forgive me, I am about to explain something that seems quite niche, but actually affects a remarkably large part of your life. Core to the business models of multiple tech companies is the humble "SaaS" (software as a service) model, where you're charged a monthly amount on a per-user basis for some sort of cloud-based software that you neither own nor control. To be clear, there's nothing inherently wrong with SaaS. For businesses, it reduces costs by removing the need to run their own infrastructure and employ people to maintain it. It can run theoretically from anywhere and costs are measurable, predictable, and adaptable to the organization's size. And, crucially, businesses don’t have to pay upfront for a license — which can cost thousands, or tens of thousands — and spread the cost across the life of the application. You can see the appeal. SaaS is one of the most dominant business models in tech, because it fits both the customer profile of "not wanting to run a bunch of infrastructure" and the tech industry's love of trapping people in distinct ecosystems that are hard to escape. While SaaS is generally a good deal for small-to-mid-sized companies, the inevitable sprawl of letting SaaS into your organization means that you're stuck with them. While managing 100 accounts might be something that your organization can do alone, how are you going to manage 1000? Or 10,000? Managing SaaS applications is a time-consuming and tedious process for large businesses, and now there are even — you guessed it — SaaS applications that can do it for you . What happens if your organization is in Europe and needs to be GDPR-compliant? What happens if you need to make sure your data is held on a server entirely separate to the rest of the company's business? While some SaaS companies offer private cloud (where the application exists on its own dedicated AWS or Azure instance), giving companies the flexibility to choose where and how to store their data, many don’t. This is the devil's deal of the three-trillion-dollar Software-As-A-Service market ( and SaaS spend is expected to crest over $230 billion in 2024 ). While the convenience of not having to build your own distinct software run on its own distinct hardware is great , or having to pay ungodly sums upfront for software licenses, you are also effectively outsourcing your entire organization's functionality to another company. With every new integration, every new seat, every new add-on their sales team makes you pay for and every new product they graciously train your staff to use, your organization becomes more burdened by the beast of SaaS. The bigger you are — or the longer you stay — the more powerful the parasite becomes, eventually burdening your organization to the point that you are effectively only as innovative as the SaaS provider you're anchored to. As an aside, "SaaS" and "cloud" kind of get mashed together sometimes because the whole idea of cloud computing is that you run stuff on other companies' computers, meaning that you have to rent it from them. This is tech's rent-seeking arm, and business was, for a while, booming. Also, the reason I'm so focused on the sale of cloud software is that compute can, at times, be a smokescreen. As organizations build their own AI integrations — through either paying for compute for their own purpose-built solutions or by integrating OpenAI's GPT — there is likely to be some revenue growth in cloud providers. That being said, we're yet to see this actually happen, outside of OpenAI's alleged $3.4 billion of yearly revenue (it still loses $5 billion a year), and generative AI's multi-billion dollar contribution to Amazon Web Services revenue over an indeterminate amount of time. I'm telling you all of this is because it's the answer to why whatever business you're working for has such shitty, shitty software. Not only is it inherently difficult to switch providers (because there's basically no incentive for them to help, and no legal imperative that forces them to), but SaaS companies have built entire ecosystems — like developers that cost six figures that develop just for Salesforce and entire companies that exist to sell other companies' (like Microsoft)'s software — specifically to make sure that anybody scaling a business inevitably ends up using their software. Almost every major SaaS company offers some kind of developer program, which in turn creates an entire cottage industry of people who exist entirely to help monopolies extend themselves. The reason that so many "channel partners" (the organizations built entirely to sell software from Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and other cloud companies) exist is because they handle the smaller, less-profitable (yet just as time consuming) markets, allowing big cloud companies to hire hundreds of thousands of sales people (or the organizations they work for) entirely on commission. They also make money — though not as much — by selling a variety of managed services. Microsoft's Unified Enterprise plan offers round-the-clock support at a percentage of your annual spend , and while there's nothing wrong per se with offering specialized, tailored support, it's also important to realize that this support is not something that exists as a means of Microsoft making money, but a means of increasing your sunk cost with Redmond. The goal of these programs, as I've suggested, is to anchor you to an ecosystem. The more money you spend — hiring developers to code specifically for one platform, paying for specialized support from one platform, adding users and add-ons and storing data and doing stuff on a system — the more costly it becomes to leave, and said cost becomes only more burdensome the larger your organization becomes. While not all Software-As-A-Service companies are parasites, the incentive for these companies is less about serving your needs and more about making sure they're so deeply embedded in your organization that they're impossible to remove. In 2011, Marc Andreessen said that “ software is eating the world.” And he was right. How does this manifest in your daily life? Well, have you ever used a piece of software at a company you work for that sucks? Was it sold by Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Atlassian or another big SaaS company? Well, it was probably bought by somebody who doesn't use the software, and it'll cost far more to remove than your annoyance matters. The burdensome presence of software like Microsoft Teams or Salesforce Platform in your life is a result of these organizations using brand recognition to sell into your organization, and once they're in there, their sales teams exist to continually find ways to increase the revenue of each user. The people making the decisions about the software you use — usually C-level executives — are doing so based on a sales pitch tailored to them and their preconceptions of what your job is rather than any firm experience, and thus they will sign year(s) long contracts based on a great sales pitch and the financials that "make sense." As a result, software from companies like Microsoft and Salesforce only has to be good enough to fool the purchaser, and perhaps a few troublesome "users" that might get trotted into negotiation where both parties may or may not have already agreed it's happening. The classic adage "Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM" is how big SaaS companies make their money, and once they've got you, it's so very, very difficult to make them leave, because the cries of agony about their questionable software come from people altogether separate from those making the decisions. In fact, a great deal of software decision-making appears to be made entirely for show. Take Microsoft PowerBI, which Nik Suresh (who you might remember from the excellent " I Will Fucking Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again ") calls " A Human Rights Violation ." PowerBI is a "business intelligence platform" sold as part of a $54.75-a-head-a-month software package (with an annual commit) that helps you create dashboards of data from your organization that you can, I assume, make judgments based on, or as Suresh puts it, something you "connect [to] spreadsheets, then you drag charts onto a page, and it makes graphs that [he] can't even describe as pretty." Suresh found, in the organization he was working in, that dashboards were barely-viewed, and worse-still didn't auto-refresh , meaning that most people viewed the data and didn't actually see if it was recent, or relevant, or useful. The thing is, PowerBI doesn't exist so that you like it or that it's useful , but so that you pay Microsoft a monthly fee and don't pay Salesforce a monthly fee to use Tableau, which offers "the world's broadest, deepest analytics platform" for the low, low (starting) price of — and this is for the regular version of Tableau — $15 a user a month, at an annual commitment, and that user can only view stuff, you're gonna need to pay $75 a user a month if you want to do everything with Tableau. As a result, it's just cheaper to use Microsoft's faux-Tableau no matter how hard it Tablows, because it's part of a bunch of other apps that you need like Word, PowerPoint, and Sharepoint, an "enterprise content management platform" that everybody hates that allows you to build internal documents and host files in a way that makes it near-impossible to share anything outside of your organization. But what're you gonna do? Pay for a whole other thing when Microsoft has you by the balls? You stupid asshole. Get out of my office. The reason I'm drawing such a vast, ungainly picture of the SaaS market is because behind every single stupid workplace application you're subjected to is the parasitic existence of big tech's SaaS parasite. Whatever organization that's burdened you with some sort of half-baked, half-useful piece of shit business app has done so because the people up top don't care if it's good, just that it works, and "works" can be an extremely fuzzy word. It doesn't matter that Microsoft Teams is universally-loathed and regularly threatens to crash every time you load it . A Microsoft salesperson used its monopoly power to cut your boss a deal to either bundle it with a bunch of other mediocre shit or they saw the name "Microsoft" and said "oh boy! I love Microsoft Word!" and pulled out their credit card so fast it left a gouge in their monitor. If you're wondering why Zoom has remained the same rat king of mediocre software and labyrinthine settings, it's for the same reason — while its business might be serving this software, it's never really sold to the people who have the misfortune of using it regularly or having to administer it. This problem only compounds in the public sector, where tech integrations are bought by people who don't use them, and the only thing more languid than a sales cycle is an organization's ability to change. The same goes for banks, or any other highly-regulated space, because said services have to be so customized and cost so much both in time and dollars invested, especially with the vast amounts of reporting and data access controls required in anything touching financial or medical data. Not to worry, big tech's software parasites have entire arms dedicated to these expensive specialized solutions , and can provide them across a number of different mediocre apps that nevertheless make it easier to stay compliant, making it borderline-impossible for smaller companies to compete. On top of that, SaaS pricing is intentionally vague, and gets more so the larger and more demanding your organization's needs are. While it might say something is $50-a-month-per-head, perhaps you need to make sure data stays in America, or that you have extra storage, or special permissions for some users, or you need some users to access some apps and not others. All of these start costing money in a way that is impossible for you, the customer, to calculate, but will magically seem to increase every year. Your business software will stay the same level of mediocre because it doesn't have to get any better. The SaaS parasite gets fatter and harder to move the larger you get, trading the convenience of having the software "all under one roof" for a product that you'd actually like. To be clear, I'm not saying any of this precludes you from buying other software, and in fact products like Microsoft 365 (Redmond’s rat king of software options) will somewhat plug into other services...assuming you can work out how. Perhaps you can use something like Zapier , a piece of software that exists to automate actions between your massive stack of software you own for some reason, because said software doesn't actually do what you need it to do, and is rarely built to be interoperable (as in having its data easily operated on by another piece of software), because making software interoperable would allow you to leave. The reason I've spent so much energy explaining this is because I want you to know why so much business software fucking sucks . If you're reading this, I'd put the likelihood that your company (or a partner) makes you use some sort of janky, horrible

China Market Update: Hang Seng & China Internet Outperforming S&P 500 Year To Date, Week In Review BETA This is a BETA experience. opt-out here Money Investing China Market Update: Hang Seng & China Internet Outperforming S&P 500 Year To Date, Week In Review By Brendan Ahern Senior Contributor I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Sep 27, 2024, 10:22am EDT Save Article Comment CLN KraneShares Week in Review Asian equities were higher this week except for Singapore, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as Hong Kong and Mainland China outperformed on rate cuts and new stimulus measures. China’s equity market surged on Tuesday as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced broad rate cuts, a lowering of mortgage down payment minimums, and a special lending facility to allow financial institutions to buy stocks, among other stimulus measures. On Thursday, the Central Committee followed up the monetary stimulus with a variety of fiscal measures, including injecting RMB 1 trillion into the largest banks, leading to another day of significant gains for China’s equity market. Net Southbound Stock Connect flows to Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares have already exceeded $5 billion in less than a month since the shares were added to the mutual market access program, which is 25% of our estimate of approximately $20 billion in total inflows. Key News Asian equities were mixed overnight as Mainland China outperformed significantly and Hong Kong extended gains. With this week’s stimulus rally, the Hang Seng Index is now above the S&P 500 in total return, at +22.32% versus the S&P 500’s +21.0%, so far this year. Meanwhile, the CSI Overseas China Internet Index is up +22.44% after today’s open in US-listed China stocks. Baidu has taken a 7% stake in the travel booking platform Trip.com. The investment makes sense as the search engine likely directs a great deal of traffic to Trip’s site. Baidu is also betting on continued heightened demand for travel in China. Shenzhen outperformed Shanghai overnight. The growth and technology-geared market saw increased volumes overnight, apparently due, in part, to a glitch in the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s trading technology, likely caused by massive demand for trading. The Renminbi has been on a tear this week as demand increases for CNY-denominated assets. The USD exchange rate is near the psychologically important “7 Level”, at 7.01 CNY per USD overnight after rising as high as 7.24 earlier this year. Read More: China Market Update: Mainland Investors Cheer Loan Prime Rate Cu According to the latest Bank of America manager survey, the most popular trade was Long Magnificent 7, followed by Short Chinese Equities, so, yes, short covering is an element of the market action, though clearly there is more to it. Positioning is very light from investors globally as everyone appears to be overweight to US technology, Japan, and India. I have advocated taking a small piece of your profits from these big three over-weights and putting it into cheap China tech, based on US valuations and election volatility, the Yen headwind, and heightened India valuations. India’s markets could be over-extended, with call options outnumbering put options by three-to-one on the India International Exchange as of data from earlier in the week. This reminds me of the “meme stock” rallies of 2021, which means it could unravel at any time. The rewind back into China has started in the opposite order of the unwind. Last out were the Chinese, though they have been coming back via Hong Kong-listed growth stock buybacks and Southbound Connect. Asia will be next, as their money came out of China and went into US stocks, which could be affected by a weakening US dollar, Japan, and India. The Middle East, Latin America, and Europe, for whom China is the biggest customer, are likely to be next, given their more balanced outlook. US institutions will be the last, in my opinion, except for hedge funds, who don’t need to call an investment committee, board, or trustee meeting to make the move. US-based mutual funds will move due to likely large China under-weights at quarter end. This could cause tracking error and negative alpha. Again, the big US institutions will be very slow, in my view. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed higher by +3.55% and 5.78%, respectively, on volume that increased by +47% from yesterday. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, which gained +7.65%, Health Care, which gained +7.02%, and Consumer Staples, which gained +6.59%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Financials, which fell -0.01%; energy, which gained +1.46%; and Communication Services, which gained +2.49%. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed higher by +2.88%, +6.05%, and +6.76%, respectively, on volume that increased by +25% from yesterday. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which gained +7.48%, Health Care, which gained +7.32%, and Real Estate, which gained +7.32%.

Following Sep 26, 2024, 10:45am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Chinese stocks surged Thursday as investors responded favorably to Beijing’s commitment to jolt its economy, with New York-listed shares of the firms adding hundreds of billions of dollars, helping boost American stocks as well. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange prior to Alibaba Group's initial price ... [+] offering in 2014. Getty Images Key Facts The 20 largest Chinese companies dually listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq tacked on $71 billion of market capitalization in the U.S., led by the more than $15 billion respective rallies from e-commerce giants Alibaba and Pinduoduo. The 20 stocks gained an average of 11% in New York by about 10:15 a.m. EDT, according to Yahoo Finance data. That helped boost the Nasdaq Composite tech stock index 1% to a two-month high; the U.S.’ other leading stock indexes, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, rose a more modest 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively partially tied to the fact the dual-listed Chinese stocks only factor into the Nasdaq. The stateside gains followed massive gains in Asian trading for Chinese companies, as China’s CSI 300 index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index tacked on about 4% apiece. The rally stems from the latest indications the Chinese government is willing to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars worth of economic stimulus and a Bloomberg report that the government is weighing a massive $142 billion capital injection into state-run banks, all building on China’s central bank announcing Wednesday it was lowering interest rates by its steepest amount ever. The last week has been a “whole shift” from the Chinese government as it brings out the “big guns” policy-wise to support growth, hedge fund billionaire David Tepper told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday morning, adding he’s buying “everything” he can get his hands on tied to Chinese equities. Surprising Fact This week is on pace to be the best week for the CSI 300, which is up 10.8%, since Dec. 2014, and for the Hang Seng, which is up 9.1%, since Oct. 2011. The “compelling” backdrop for a “tactical recovery” came as new money flowed in following the weakest hedge fund allocation to Chinese stocks in a decade, noted Goldman Sachs analyst Kinger Lau in a Wednesday note to clients. Crucial Quote “This could be a game changer” for Chinese stocks, Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investor officer, Americas, wrote to clients Thursday, though she noted risks from aggressive U.S. tariffs should former President Donald Trump win the presidency in November. Key Background The 20 largest Chinese stocks used in the market value calculations are according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s Jan. 2024 compilation . Despite this week’s explosive rally, Chinese stocks are mired in an extended slump as the country’s economy struggles to return to its pre-pandemic expansion rate. The CSI 300 has provided a 6% return to investors year-to-date and a -21% return over the last three years, far underperforming the S&P’s 21% year-to-date and 35% three-year returns. U.S. trading of Chinese stocks involves the exchange of American depositary receipts, which entitle investors to equity in Chinese firms without direct ownership. Tangent European luxury stocks, which were badly battered by diminished demand in China, soared Thursday as the market adjusted to optimism about a Chinese recovery. Shares of French firms LVMH, Hermès and Dior rose 9% apiece in Paris trading. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Send me a secure tip .

WordPress Drama: From the Sidelines - Eric Mann's Blog Skip to the content Blog Writing Search LinkedIn Portfolio Search for: Search for: Last week I had the opportunity to attend and reflect on WordCamp US 2024 in Portland. It was a great event that left me more than a little conflicted about the state of WordPress today – specifically the stagnant level of innovation I see with popular WordPress hosts. For those who missed the news, the event capped off with an address from Matt Mullenweg , one of the co-founders of the WordPress project. It was a polarizing talk that called out a specific host (WP Engine) and their private equity investors (Silver Lake) for purported harm to the community . Since then, WP Engine has openly published a cease and desist letter against Matt and his company Automattic. Then Matt and his legal team published a counter to them alleging trademark infringement and intentional market confusion on the part of WP Engine. He doubled down this week by blocking WP Engine from free access to the APIs provided by WordPress.org for installing and updating WordPress software. It’s a messy situation that has many people conflicted on where they stand and how to respond. Why Open Source Matters WordPress is free and open source software. It’s built by a community around the world, many of whom write the software on their own time with their own resources and give it freely to the world. I’ve personally written a lot of code for WordPress, both in the form of free plugins and code for the core system. My work – for which I was not paid – literally powers millions of websites. I give back because WordPress is one of the things that made me who I am today. It introduced me to blogging. 1 I had a blog before WordPress, built manually using Microsoft FrontPage and published to my university servers over FTP. But … it was inconsistent and, except for a cached copy on a thumb drive, no longer exists. It exposed me to the GPL, copyleft licensing, and the idea of free software. WordPress introduced me to the broader PHP community, where I’ve been an active speaker, writer, and core contributor for nearly 20 years. Blogging directly led to one of my first jobs. Contributing code back to the WordPress community led to another. Speaking about PHP led to being asked to write multiple books on the language and my eventual inclusion into the project as a release manager. I also know, from first-hand conversations, of the impact my own work has had on the lives of individuals. From the engineer in Kenya who used my blog to start coding and eventually provide for his family through a job in the WordPress space. To the inmate learning to code because of my books. There are a lot of other stories – but the point is that WordPress made me a better developer and helped me put my work into the world. And my work has had a direct, positive impact in the lives of many. It’s personally rewarding for me, but reinforces the fact that WordPress (and the people who build and fight for it) is a major force of good in the world. Who is Right? Disclaimer I am not a lawyer and this stance is my personal opinion. It does not reflect deep legal advice or an detailed understanding of any relevant legal precedents. This is merely my read on the situation based on my own background in the community and events / situations to which I’ve been privy. Trademarks There has been a lot of confusion in the past between WordPress the open source project and wordpress.com, the paid hosting service provided by Automattic. Given the legacy of the “WordPress” trademark, and Automattic being granted explicit rights to use the trademark commercially, this confusion is understood and has been argued to death in the path. WP Engine never calls itself “WordPress Engine” in marketing. However, searches for “WordPress Engine” do yield sponsored advertisements for WP Engine. Until this week , they even had partner agencies listed on their own website as “WordPress Engine Preferred Partner Agenc[ies].” 2 An archive.org search shows that this particular agency listing was changed from “WordPress Engine Preferred Partner Agency” to “WP Engine Preferred Partner Agency” on September 24, 2024. At the time of this writing, at least one other partner still references “WordPress Engine” on pages with case studies. Even if WP Engine isn’t actively trying to brand itself as “WordPress Engine,” they aren’t doing anything to avoid others doing so. A talk at their recent DE{CODE} conference even referred to them as such. It’s clear they are directly benefiting from the name confusion but they do not have the same rights to the trademark as Automattic and WordPress.com. Community Contributions The initial arguments made by Matt were related to WP Engine’s failure to contribute back to the open source community. These are arguments that have yet to be addressed and are incredibly valid. Especially when, amidst all of these conversations, WP Engine advertises their contributions to WordPress on their homepage! WP Engine homepage, claiming passion for WordPress and contributions to the open source project. It’s true that WP Engine has published tutorials and their own plugins to enhance their product offering. But are those contributions to WordPress itself? The first argument from Matt is that WP Engine as a company only contributes 40 people-hours per week to the project, which does not reflect a culture focused on “ensuring an open future with […] contributions to WordPress.” End-user Impact The biggest unfortunate side effect of this battle is the impact on end users. When Matt blocked WP Engine servers from communicating with WordPress.org’s APIs, many people (rightfully?) flagged concern about how this would be seen by stakeholders. Most of those stakeholders won’t know, understand, or even care about the issues above – all they will see is instability and an overall concern about the safety and security of the project. That’s a valid concern. But it’s also a misplaced one. Actions have consequences. Inaction also has consequences. The inaction on WP Engine’s part to address very valid concerns raised directly by Matt and his team led consequentially to the removal of API access – an issue that any web host should have had a reasonable protection against. Any system pulling remote data from a third party source should have protections against that source becoming unavailable, whether that’s a pull-through cache or even just a circuit-breaker in their system. WP Engine, a very large and successful host, did not have protections in their system for an unexpected outage of WordPress.org API services. As a result, end users could not fetch updates and instead saw errors. 3 WP Engine has since stood up a proxy for the services provided by WordPress.org and various reports suggest the outage is, at least for now, resolved. I feel for impacted end users. But that they were impacted at all is WP Engine’s fault and responsibility to fix. They’ve been providing access to free services hosted on WordPress.org and, due to a major disagreement on community contributions and trademark licensing, permission to use those services has been revoked. It sucks, but to pin the blame on anyone other than WP Engine is disingenuous. Earlier in my career, I built a virtual machine image for running Ubuntu on top of Hyper-V for running a vvv developer environment. It worked for me, and I published the image to allow colleagues to use it as well. Down the road, another developer leveraged the image as a base for building a completely unrelated product. I only found out when my cloud service provider sent me the bill for serving that image to the developer’s thousands of users. I contacted the developer and asked them to pitch in to cover the cost – they refused. So I deleted the image. My removal of that image hurt Hyper-V users of vvv. It hurt users of Laravel Homestead , who were also using my image for free. While I regret hurting those users, it was because another member of the community chose to build a paid service atop my free services – costing me thousands of dollars in infrastructure – while refusing to contribute in any way (i.e. paying me a fee or hosting their own image) to aid in the delivery of those services. WP Engine has done the same thing. They’ve built a powerful, profitable platform leveraging free services provided by a third party. That third party asked them to give back to the community and, when they refused, revoked their access to those free services. This revocation hurts end users, yes, but it’s WP Engine who is responsible for that harm. Do not misplace that blame. Where To From Here? I don’t know how this ends. I don’t know what the lasting impact will be to WordPress or even the broader open source community from this battle. What I do know is that I’ll still continue to use WordPress. I’ll still contribute to open source. I’ll still advocate for a free, open web and the tools and technologies that keep it that way. The whole dispute could easily have been circumvented if only WP Engine would live up to their stated culture of being “passionate for giving back and WordPress.” Fixing the damage that’s been done will be hard, but is possible. There’s a path forward if only the decision makers involved are willing to tread. At the end of the day, I’m on the sidelines here, waiting to see how the entire situation evolves and resolves. It’s painful to watch, but will hopefully answer a lot of questions about the health of this particular part of the open source community. Will the conflict resolve amicably? Will the legal battle result in further litigation that sets the precedent for these disagreements in the future? Who will still meet up with me at WordCamp US 2025? I hope to see answers to all of these questions soon … 1 I had a blog before WordPress, built manually using Microsoft FrontPage and published to my university servers over FTP.

Blackstone Sells Motel 6 To Oyo In $525M Deal, Adding 1,450 Hotels To Indian Giant's Portfolio Read full article AJ Fabino Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 1:15 PM 3 min read Link Copied 1 Blackstone Sells Motel 6 To Oyo In $525M Deal, Adding 1,450 Hotels To Indian Giant's Portfolio Blackstone, the private equity powerhouse, has agreed to sell Motel 6, the iconic American budget hotel chain, to Oyo, an Indian hotel operator, for $525 million in cash. The deal, reported by The Wall Street Journal, marks Oyo’s expansion in the U.S. market and the end of Blackstone’s decadelong ownership of the budget lodging brand. The transaction includes G6 Hospitality, the parent company of Motel 6 and its extended-stay offshoot, Studio 6. With the acquisition, Oyo will add roughly 1,450 hotels across 49 states and five Canadian provinces, boosting its presence in North America. Don't Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ? Motel 6, founded in 1962 in Santa Barbara, California, has been a fixture of American road trips for decades. The chain’s name originated from its affordable original $6-per-night rate. Under Blackstone’s ownership since 2012, the brand has seen much growth and profitability. Rob Harper, head of Blackstone Real Estate Asset Management Americas, highlighted the success of their investment, saying in a statement that it had “generated over $1 billion in profit” during their ownership period. Blackstone had initially acquired G6 Hospitality for $1.9 billion. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! For Oyo, which entered the U.S. market in 2019, the acquisition represents a major milestone in its expansion strategy. The company operates over 320 hotels across 35 states and aims to add about 250 more this year. In a statement, Gautam Swaroop, CEO of Oyo International, cited Motel 6’s strong brand recognition, financial profile and network in the U.S. "This acquisition is a significant milestone for a startup company like us to strengthen our international presence," Swaroop said in the statement. "Motel 6's strong brand recognition, financial profile and network in the U.S. combined with OYO's entrepreneurial spirit will be instrumental in charting a sustainable path forward for the company which will continue to operate as a separate entity." See Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100 . The India-based hotel operator, describing itself as a startup, has received backing from Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group. However, its rapid growth has not been without controversy, with some incidents in India raising questions about its business practices. Story continues According to the WSJ report, the deal is expected to close by the end of the year subject to customary closing conditions. Oyo plans to operate Motel 6 as a separate entity, maintaining the brand’s identity while leveraging its extensive network. The transaction points to the ongoing consolidation in the hotel industry. As budget-conscious travelers continue to seek affordable accommodations , combining Oyo’s technology-driven approach and Motel 6’s established brand could reshape the landscape of economy lodging in North America.

Murdoch’s REA Makes Fourth Bid for UK Housing Site Rightmove Read full article 1 / 2 Murdoch’s REA Makes Fourth Bid for UK Housing Site Rightmove Damian Shepherd and Leonard Kehnscherper Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 4:25 PM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- REA Group Ltd. has made a fourth takeover proposal in less than a month for Rightmove Plc, valuing the UK property portal at about £6.2 billion ($8.7 billion). Most Read from Bloomberg A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents The Corner Store Comeback New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Rightmove said it would consider the cash-and-stock package — a step it’s taken with past REA proposals before rejecting them. The firm’s London-listed shares are far below the indicated offer value, in a sign traders aren’t banking on REA to be successful before Monday’s deadline to make a firm takeover bid. Friday’s proposal values Rightmove shares at 775 pence each, plus a special dividend of 6 pence per share, according to an REA statement. Based on the Australian firm’s share price on Friday, the total offer values Rightmove at about £6.2 billion, or 11% higher than REA’s initial bid and 41% above the company’s market price before the takeover interest emerged. REA, which is part of media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s empire, reiterated its “disappointment and surprise” at Rightmove’s repeated rejections of its prior proposals. It requested an extension to the Sept. 30 regulatory deadline to make a formal offer. In response, Rightmove said on Friday its board “will consider the latest proposal together with its financial advisers and, in the meantime, shareholders are urged to take no action.” The UK’s go-to website for property listings has grown steadily in recent years and it’s poised to benefit as declining interest rates and the Labour government’s planning reforms look set to boost the housing market. Sales are expected to rise by a further high-single-digit percentage in 2024-25, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report. Shares in Rightmove rose 1.3% to 673.8 pence by 4:10 p.m. “Rightmove’s share price continues to suggest the market does not expect this deal to go through, and we are of a similar view,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Doyinsola Sanyaolu said in a note to clients. REA said it had “repeatedly requested” meetings with Rightmove, but that none had taken place. The Australian firm said that it had been in contact with Rightmove’s shareholders, who would hold about 20% of the combined group’s shares based on the latest offer. Iain McCombie at fund manager Baillie Gifford — Rightmove’s fifth-largest shareholder — told investors at a conference earlier this month that the fund won’t sell its shares “cheaply.” A Baillie Gifford spokesperson said on Friday that McCombie has nothing to add to these comments. Story continues An offer price of less than 800 pence is unlikely to be accepted, and REA may need to improve it even if it turns hostile by appealing directly to Rightmove shareholders, according to a BI report this week. REA is among a small number of companies suited to buying Rightmove. US real estate firm CoStar Group Inc. purchased rival property portal OnTheMarket Plc for about £100 million last year, while private equity investor Silver Lake Management already owns Zoopla Ltd., effectively ruling them both out of a deal. By keeping its doors closed to REA, Rightmove has already managed to extract a quick succession of sweeteners from its suitor. The risk for Rightmove’s shareholders is that REA walks away and shares in the UK company slump. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Rightmove’s receipt of REA’s fourth takeover proposal — worth 775p a share (based on REA’s closing price on Sept. 27) plus an additional special dividend of 6p a share — is still likely to be rejected by the former’s board and shareholders. We maintain the view that only an offer above 800 pence is likely to sway acceptance. — Tom Ward, BI analyst --With assistance from Joe Easton. (Adds market context from second paragraph.)

Trump’s $100,000 Watches Are the Most Tragic Celebrity Watch Yet | WIRED Skip to main content Security Politics Gear The Big Story Business Science Culture Ideas Merch Podcasts Video Newsletters Magazine Travel Steven Levy's Plaintext Column WIRED Classics from the Archive Events WIRED Insider WIRED Consulting Jobs Coupons Save this story Save Save this story Save Celebrities partnering with watch brands is nothing new. Sometimes a bona fide watch enthusiast like John Mayer partners with Audemars Piguet, or Ed Sheeran (owner of a unique Patek Philippe, no less) teams up with Casio. Then there's the other end of the scale, where controversial Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and his own watch company resides. Now, however, there’s a new nadir: the Trump Watch. Announced this week by former US president Donald Trump, the collection consists of two pieces. One is called “ Fight Fight Fight ” and is priced from $499, and the other is the “ Victory Tourbillon .” The latter is claimed to be made from solid 18-karat gold, with 122 diamonds and a tourbillon automatic movement. It’s priced at a nice, round $100,000—about three times the price of an equivalent Rolex Submariner —and, yes, crypto payment is available. The watches are claimed to feature “premium, Swiss-Made materials and intricate details,” but so far as we can tell, the Fight Fight Fight uses a movement by Japanese company Seiko, while the Victory Tourbillon has a movement alleged to be partially built from Chinese components. It gets better. In what quickly starts to resemble the tweet-riddled fever dreams of the extremely online, the watches are produced by a company called TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC, which is based in Sheridan, Wyoming, and, despite no watchmaking history to speak of, has a license agreement to use the Trump name for its timepieces. “We also accept Bitcoin as payment!”, the GetTrumpWatches website yells, as if handing over actual dollars to a company who admits the images of the timepieces “are for illustration purposes only” isn’t enough to raise an eyebrow. We’ll come back to the Tourbillon in a moment. For now, let's look at the cheaper of the two, called the Fighter. At least that’s what the website address suggests it’s called, but it’s also described as the “Fight Fight Fight Watch”—and in the description of the black and gold colorway it’s “The Fight Fight Fight Black Watch.” Either way, it resembles a Rolex Submariner described down a patchy phone line. But don’t just take our word for it. WIRED Watch expert Tim Barber told us: “Trump evidently has some cut-through among certain watch fans, since the gold sneakers he auctioned earlier this year were bought by Roman Sharf , one of the most prominent gray-market watch dealers, with a sizable YouTube following." (Incidentally, the companies that made the gold sneakers and the new Trump Watches were established by the same register agent, Andrew Pierce of Cloud Peak Law, Wyoming.)

As it happens, all-gold watches being very on trend in the luxury market at the moment, he joins Rolex in producing a gold dive watch this year. But I would be less confident of this sharing any other qualities with a Rolex.” Trump Watches says the timepiece “was made for those who combine boldness and elegance,” and that its gold accents “create a tasteful balance of color, perfect for a dress watch”—which is odd when you consider the fact this is quite clearly a dive watch. Trump's $500 dive/dress watches boast a screw-down case back which features an image of the former president after he narrowly escaped assassination, and an automatic movement that costs $55. Courtesy of TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC The screw-down case back features an image of Trump after he narrowly escaped assassination, along with his signature, plus a “200 meters” engraving. Strangely, all three variants of the Fight Fight Fight have the same waterproofing claim on their case back, but only the limited-edition $799 all-gold version states as much on its product page. The other two models, each priced at $499, state 200 meters on their cases, but contradict this with 100 meters of water resistance in their specifications. Perhaps consider removing your Fight Fight Fight before you go swimming.

The other two variants have just a date window and use the simpler NH35 movement. Both movements can be bought online from about $55 . Again, this seems completely at odds with claims on the Trump Watches website of “premium, Swiss-Made materials and intricate details.” The Trump Victory Tourbillons cost $100,000 and are limited to 147 pieces, but our watch expert says “these would suck as $50 mall watches.” Courtesy of TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC Now for the Tourbillon, the $100,000 flagship of the Trump watch collection. “This isn’t just any watch,” the former president said. “It’s one of the best watches made,” he adds without context. Limited to 147 pieces—although the website admits they’re made to order—the watch is offered with a solid gold case and dial, a gold case and black dial, or a rose gold case and dial. All three have the “Trump” name at the twelve o’clock position and a window revealing their tourbillon movement within. The watch is claimed to use a “TX07 Tourbillon” with 105 hours of power reserve, but finding any record of such a movement online is tricky. Watch commentator Nico Leonard van der Horst said in an Instagram post : “This is hilarious … the manufacturer of this movement is Olivier Mory, who ironically is known for making very affordable Tourbillons half made in China, half made in Switzerland.” Van der Horst added: “If you were to buy this movement and put it in your own watch, you would be able to buy it for under $3.5k.” Most Popular Gear This Talking Pet Collar Is Like a Chatbot for Your Dog By Boone Ashworth Gear A Rubberized Cybertruck Is Plowing Through European Pedestrian Safety Rules By Carlton Reid Gear The Best Fitness Trackers and Watches for Everyone By Adrienne So Gear The Best iPad to Buy (and a Few to Avoid) By Brenda Stolyar The movement is visible through an exhibition case back, which in marketing material from Trump Watches seemingly includes the personalized message from Trump “James, let’s think big!”, along with Trump’s signature. Bizarrely, the diamond-covered bezel appears to have grips around its circumference. These are usually only seen on rotating bezels, but since there are no markings on this bezel, there’s no reason for it to rotate, and thus no reason for the gripped design. “The watches are as tawdry, ill-designed, and generic as you’d expect, and look as though they’ve been assembled from leftover bits in the parts bin.” Courtesy of TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC Back to Barber for more informed analysis: “The watches are as tawdry, ill-designed, and generic as you’d expect, and look as though they’ve been assembled from leftover bits in the parts bin of whichever white label company was prepared to take Trump‘s dime. These would suck as $50 mall watches, let alone as a facsimile of luxury watchmaking. “Nevertheless, these monstrosities may not be the worst watches associated with Donald Trump. Back in 2019, Moritz Grossmann, a German firm specializing in high-end artisanal horology, saw fit to mark a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-Un with a commemorative limited edition. Although arguably even more brazen in its bad taste, at around €13,000, it probably offered rather better value for the workmanship involved.” The latest Trump watches are available to order now, if you really must, but the website states vaguely how shipping starts in “October/November/December.” Despite only accepting pre-orders at this stage, the seller warns “there are no refunds. All sales are final.” It adds: “Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments … We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive.” Most rarely find themselves in the market for a $100,000 watch, but WIRED imagines buyers generally seek more assurances on when their expensive purchases might arrive. The Trump Watches website says money spent on these watches does not go to Trump’s presidential campaign, adding: “Trump Watches are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” You Might Also Like … In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED’s archive Interview: Marissa Mayer is not a feminist.

One theme in many of the products we're about to launch -- News Feed, Timeline, Open Graph -- is that people love nice big photos. A lot of the time people don't even understand how the new News Feed or Timeline work, but they love those products because of the bigger and richer photos. While this is nice in the short term, I view this as a big strategic risk for us if we don't completely own the photos space. If Instagram continues to kick ass on mobile or if Google buys them, then over the next few years they could easily add pieces of their service that copy what we're doing now, and if they have a growing number of people's photos then that's a real issue for us. They're growing extremely quickly right now. It seems like they double every couple of months or so, and their base is already ~5-10m users. As soon as we launch a compelling product a lot of people will use ours more and future Instagram users will find no reason to use them. But at the current rate, literally every couple of months that we waste translates to a double in their growth and a harder position for us to work our way out of. I get that there are also team issues and we'll need to work through those, but if there are actually people available who could build this more quickly then I think we'd be crazy not to do that. I don't know if there are actually people available or what the costs of that would be though, so it's hard to give you a clear answer here. The message I got from your note though was that you care more about fixing the team than shipping the app. I think we need to do both, but I do think it's a crisis that we don't have a mobile photos app out and I'd prioritize pushing that out as much as possible. Getting the team to a good state is not a milestone by itself that I care about. Separately, I just don't understand why this app is so hard to build. It basically seems like a camera view, some filters, controls for deleting/tagging/captioning your photos, integration into a composer that already exists, and a skin for a photos feed whose infrastructure should already exist. We've had designs that I've been fine with for months. The only piece that seems technically new for us is the filters, but it seems like we're doing okay on those now after a long parallel track. What is so hard about the camera view, feed filters and composer integration? Are we building other unnecessary features? I guess my basic point is this: I get that your team has issues, so fix them and ship the app. I don't see why this should be so hard, and I don't think we should accept any excuses for not getting this done in a short period of time.

As some of you know, we have been interested in this company for some time, but have been pursuing a "build-it-ourselves" strategy. Our interest became more acute after learning that Microsoft has already made a serious offer. The team believes that this is an important transaction for us, for both offensive and defensive reasons. I have attached the deal review presentation for Project Liberty discussed at EMG. I have also provided a quick summary below of the background to the deal as well as our and Microsoft's potential rationale for acquiring DoubleClick. We have heard from reliable sources that that Microsoft has made a bid in the $1.8B to $2.0B range. This weekend we plan to make a competitive bid by means of a non-binding term sheet/indication of interest. Of course, we will come back to you for formal approval as the process unfolds. Background: EMG has given approval to pursue the acquisition of DoubleClick, the leading online ad serving company. Hellman Friedman and JMI Equity began shopping DoubleClick early last week after receiving an indication of interest from Microsoft. Google product, engineering and corporate development teams met last week with Double Click management for preliminary due diligence. Acquisition price is expected to be at least $2B, based on Microsoft's current bid of near $2B (a Microsoft executive told a friend of the company they they were buying Liberty for $2B). We expect that the seller will prefer cash. The process is moving quickly. Google's Rationale for Acquiring DoubleClick: Own DoubleClick's customer footprint to accelerate time to market for our own advertiser and publisher ad serving products Acquisition of DoubleClick by Microsoft would make it very challenging for us to win customers for our own advertiser ad server, which would impair our opportunities in the brand ad market A Microsoft-owned DoubleClick represents a major competitive threat to our AdSense for Content business (see Microsoft Rationale below) Microsoft’s Potential Rationale for Acquiring DoubleClick: Access remnant inventory from Doubleclick's publisher ad server customer base to quickly scale its ad network. Use DoubleClick's advertiser ad server position to harm Yahoo!'s business, driving down its valuation ahead of a potential acquisition (as relayed by Microsoft executive to friend of Google). Feel free to call me with any feedback, questions or concerns. Thanks, David [This document is from U.S. v.

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Sep 27, 2024, 10:22am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Week in Review Asian equities were higher this week except for Singapore, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as Hong Kong and Mainland China outperformed on rate cuts and new stimulus measures. China’s equity market surged on Tuesday as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced broad rate cuts, a lowering of mortgage down payment minimums, and a special lending facility to allow financial institutions to buy stocks, among other stimulus measures. On Thursday, the Central Committee followed up the monetary stimulus with a variety of fiscal measures, including injecting RMB 1 trillion into the largest banks, leading to another day of significant gains for China’s equity market. Net Southbound Stock Connect flows to Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares have already exceeded $5 billion in less than a month since the shares were added to the mutual market access program, which is 25% of our estimate of approximately $20 billion in total inflows. Key News Asian equities were mixed overnight as Mainland China outperformed significantly and Hong Kong extended gains. With this week’s stimulus rally, the Hang Seng Index is now above the S&P 500 in total return, at +22.32% versus the S&P 500’s +21.0%, so far this year. Meanwhile, the CSI Overseas China Internet Index is up +22.44% after today’s open in US-listed China stocks. Baidu has taken a 7% stake in the travel booking platform Trip.com. The investment makes sense as the search engine likely directs a great deal of traffic to Trip’s site. Baidu is also betting on continued heightened demand for travel in China. Shenzhen outperformed Shanghai overnight. The growth and technology-geared market saw increased volumes overnight, apparently due, in part, to a glitch in the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s trading technology, likely caused by massive demand for trading. The Renminbi has been on a tear this week as demand increases for CNY-denominated assets. The USD exchange rate is near the psychologically important “7 Level”, at 7.01 CNY per USD overnight after rising as high as 7.24 earlier this year. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor According to the latest Bank of America manager survey, the most popular trade was Long Magnificent 7, followed by Short Chinese Equities, so, yes, short covering is an element of the market action, though clearly there is more to it. Positioning is very light from investors globally as everyone appears to be overweight to US technology, Japan, and India. I have advocated taking a small piece of your profits from these big three over-weights and putting it into cheap China tech, based on US valuations and election volatility, the Yen headwind, and heightened India valuations. India’s markets could be over-extended, with call options outnumbering put options by three-to-one on the India International Exchange as of data from earlier in the week. This reminds me of the “meme stock” rallies of 2021, which means it could unravel at any time. The rewind back into China has started in the opposite order of the unwind. Last out were the Chinese, though they have been coming back via Hong Kong-listed growth stock buybacks and Southbound Connect. Asia will be next, as their money came out of China and went into US stocks, which could be affected by a weakening US dollar, Japan, and India. The Middle East, Latin America, and Europe, for whom China is the biggest customer, are likely to be next, given their more balanced outlook. US institutions will be the last, in my opinion, except for hedge funds, who don’t need to call an investment committee, board, or trustee meeting to make the move. US-based mutual funds will move due to likely large China under-weights at quarter end. This could cause tracking error and negative alpha. Again, the big US institutions will be very slow, in my view. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed higher by +3.55% and 5.78%, respectively, on volume that increased by +47% from yesterday. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, which gained +7.65%, Health Care, which gained +7.02%, and Consumer Staples, which gained +6.59%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Financials, which fell -0.01%; energy, which gained +1.46%; and Communication Services, which gained +2.49%. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed higher by +2.88%, +6.05%, and +6.76%, respectively, on volume that increased by +25% from yesterday. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which gained +7.48%, Health Care, which gained +7.32%, and Real Estate, which gained +7.32%.

WordPress Drama: From the Sidelines - Eric Mann's Blog Skip to the content Blog Writing Search LinkedIn Portfolio Search for: Search for: Last week I had the opportunity to attend and reflect on WordCamp US 2024 in Portland. It was a great event that left me more than a little conflicted about the state of WordPress today – specifically the stagnant level of innovation I see with popular WordPress hosts. For those who missed the news, the event capped off with an address from Matt Mullenweg , one of the co-founders of the WordPress project. It was a polarizing talk that called out a specific host (WP Engine) and their private equity investors (Silver Lake) for purported harm to the community . Since then, WP Engine has openly published a cease and desist letter against Matt and his company Automattic. Then Matt and his legal team published a counter to them alleging trademark infringement and intentional market confusion on the part of WP Engine. He doubled down this week by blocking WP Engine from free access to the APIs provided by WordPress.org for installing and updating WordPress software. It’s a messy situation that has many people conflicted on where they stand and how to respond. Why Open Source Matters WordPress is free and open source software. It’s built by a community around the world, many of whom write the software on their own time with their own resources and give it freely to the world. I’ve personally written a lot of code for WordPress, both in the form of free plugins and code for the core system. My work – for which I was not paid – literally powers millions of websites. I give back because WordPress is one of the things that made me who I am today. It introduced me to blogging. 1 I had a blog before WordPress, built manually using Microsoft FrontPage and published to my university servers over FTP. But … it was inconsistent and, except for a cached copy on a thumb drive, no longer exists. It exposed me to the GPL, copyleft licensing, and the idea of free software. WordPress introduced me to the broader PHP community, where I’ve been an active speaker, writer, and core contributor for nearly 20 years. Blogging directly led to one of my first jobs. Contributing code back to the WordPress community led to another. Speaking about PHP led to being asked to write multiple books on the language and my eventual inclusion into the project as a release manager. I also know, from first-hand conversations, of the impact my own work has had on the lives of individuals. From the engineer in Kenya who used my blog to start coding and eventually provide for his family through a job in the WordPress space. To the inmate learning to code because of my books. There are a lot of other stories – but the point is that WordPress made me a better developer and helped me put my work into the world. And my work has had a direct, positive impact in the lives of many. It’s personally rewarding for me, but reinforces the fact that WordPress (and the people who build and fight for it) is a major force of good in the world. Who is Right? Disclaimer I am not a lawyer and this stance is my personal opinion. It does not reflect deep legal advice or an detailed understanding of any relevant legal precedents. This is merely my read on the situation based on my own background in the community and events / situations to which I’ve been privy. Trademarks There has been a lot of confusion in the past between WordPress the open source project and wordpress.com, the paid hosting service provided by Automattic. Given the legacy of the “WordPress” trademark, and Automattic being granted explicit rights to use the trademark commercially, this confusion is understood and has been argued to death in the path. WP Engine never calls itself “WordPress Engine” in marketing. However, searches for “WordPress Engine” do yield sponsored advertisements for WP Engine. Until this week , they even had partner agencies listed on their own website as “WordPress Engine Preferred Partner Agenc[ies].” 2 An archive.org search shows that this particular agency listing was changed from “WordPress Engine Preferred Partner Agency” to “WP Engine Preferred Partner Agency” on September 24, 2024. At the time of this writing, at least one other partner still references “WordPress Engine” on pages with case studies. Even if WP Engine isn’t actively trying to brand itself as “WordPress Engine,” they aren’t doing anything to avoid others doing so. A talk at their recent DE{CODE} conference even referred to them as such. It’s clear they are directly benefiting from the name confusion but they do not have the same rights to the trademark as Automattic and WordPress.com. Community Contributions The initial arguments made by Matt were related to WP Engine’s failure to contribute back to the open source community. These are arguments that have yet to be addressed and are incredibly valid. Especially when, amidst all of these conversations, WP Engine advertises their contributions to WordPress on their homepage! WP Engine homepage, claiming passion for WordPress and contributions to the open source project. It’s true that WP Engine has published tutorials and their own plugins to enhance their product offering. But are those contributions to WordPress itself? The first argument from Matt is that WP Engine as a company only contributes 40 people-hours per week to the project, which does not reflect a culture focused on “ensuring an open future with […] contributions to WordPress.” End-user Impact The biggest unfortunate side effect of this battle is the impact on end users. When Matt blocked WP Engine servers from communicating with WordPress.org’s APIs, many people (rightfully?) flagged concern about how this would be seen by stakeholders. Most of those stakeholders won’t know, understand, or even care about the issues above – all they will see is instability and an overall concern about the safety and security of the project. That’s a valid concern. But it’s also a misplaced one. Actions have consequences. Inaction also has consequences. The inaction on WP Engine’s part to address very valid concerns raised directly by Matt and his team led consequentially to the removal of API access – an issue that any web host should have had a reasonable protection against. Any system pulling remote data from a third party source should have protections against that source becoming unavailable, whether that’s a pull-through cache or even just a circuit-breaker in their system. WP Engine, a very large and successful host, did not have protections in their system for an unexpected outage of WordPress.org API services. As a result, end users could not fetch updates and instead saw errors. 3 WP Engine has since stood up a proxy for the services provided by WordPress.org and various reports suggest the outage is, at least for now, resolved. I feel for impacted end users. But that they were impacted at all is WP Engine’s fault and responsibility to fix. They’ve been providing access to free services hosted on WordPress.org and, due to a major disagreement on community contributions and trademark licensing, permission to use those services has been revoked. It sucks, but to pin the blame on anyone other than WP Engine is disingenuous. Earlier in my career, I built a virtual machine image for running Ubuntu on top of Hyper-V for running a vvv developer environment. It worked for me, and I published the image to allow colleagues to use it as well. Down the road, another developer leveraged the image as a base for building a completely unrelated product. I only found out when my cloud service provider sent me the bill for serving that image to the developer’s thousands of users. I contacted the developer and asked them to pitch in to cover the cost – they refused. So I deleted the image. My removal of that image hurt Hyper-V users of vvv. It hurt users of Laravel Homestead , who were also using my image for free. While I regret hurting those users, it was because another member of the community chose to build a paid service atop my free services – costing me thousands of dollars in infrastructure – while refusing to contribute in any way (i.e. paying me a fee or hosting their own image) to aid in the delivery of those services. WP Engine has done the same thing. They’ve built a powerful, profitable platform leveraging free services provided by a third party. That third party asked them to give back to the community and, when they refused, revoked their access to those free services. This revocation hurts end users, yes, but it’s WP Engine who is responsible for that harm. Do not misplace that blame. Where To From Here? I don’t know how this ends. I don’t know what the lasting impact will be to WordPress or even the broader open source community from this battle. What I do know is that I’ll still continue to use WordPress. I’ll still contribute to open source. I’ll still advocate for a free, open web and the tools and technologies that keep it that way. The whole dispute could easily have been circumvented if only WP Engine would live up to their stated culture of being “passionate for giving back and WordPress.” Fixing the damage that’s been done will be hard, but is possible. There’s a path forward if only the decision makers involved are willing to tread. At the end of the day, I’m on the sidelines here, waiting to see how the entire situation evolves and resolves. It’s painful to watch, but will hopefully answer a lot of questions about the health of this particular part of the open source community. Will the conflict resolve amicably? Will the legal battle result in further litigation that sets the precedent for these disagreements in the future? Who will still meet up with me at WordCamp US 2025? I hope to see answers to all of these questions soon … 1 I had a blog before WordPress, built manually using Microsoft FrontPage and published to my university servers over FTP. But … it was inconsistent and, except for a cached copy on a thumb drive, no longer exists. 2 An archive.org search shows that this particular agency listing was changed from “WordPress Engine Preferred Partner Agency” to “WP Engine Preferred Partner Agency” on September 24, 2024.

Murdoch’s REA Makes Fourth Bid for UK Housing Site Rightmove Read full article 1 / 2 Murdoch’s REA Makes Fourth Bid for UK Housing Site Rightmove Damian Shepherd and Leonard Kehnscherper Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 4:25 PM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- REA Group Ltd. has made a fourth takeover proposal in less than a month for Rightmove Plc, valuing the UK property portal at about £6.2 billion ($8.7 billion). Most Read from Bloomberg A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents The Corner Store Comeback New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Rightmove said it would consider the cash-and-stock package — a step it’s taken with past REA proposals before rejecting them. The firm’s London-listed shares are far below the indicated offer value, in a sign traders aren’t banking on REA to be successful before Monday’s deadline to make a firm takeover bid. Friday’s proposal values Rightmove shares at 775 pence each, plus a special dividend of 6 pence per share, according to an REA statement. Based on the Australian firm’s share price on Friday, the total offer values Rightmove at about £6.2 billion, or 11% higher than REA’s initial bid and 41% above the company’s market price before the takeover interest emerged. REA, which is part of media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s empire, reiterated its “disappointment and surprise” at Rightmove’s repeated rejections of its prior proposals. It requested an extension to the Sept. 30 regulatory deadline to make a formal offer. In response, Rightmove said on Friday its board “will consider the latest proposal together with its financial advisers and, in the meantime, shareholders are urged to take no action.” The UK’s go-to website for property listings has grown steadily in recent years and it’s poised to benefit as declining interest rates and the Labour government’s planning reforms look set to boost the housing market. Sales are expected to rise by a further high-single-digit percentage in 2024-25, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report. Shares in Rightmove rose 1.3% to 673.8 pence by 4:10 p.m. “Rightmove’s share price continues to suggest the market does not expect this deal to go through, and we are of a similar view,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Doyinsola Sanyaolu said in a note to clients. REA said it had “repeatedly requested” meetings with Rightmove, but that none had taken place. The Australian firm said that it had been in contact with Rightmove’s shareholders, who would hold about 20% of the combined group’s shares based on the latest offer. Iain McCombie at fund manager Baillie Gifford — Rightmove’s fifth-largest shareholder — told investors at a conference earlier this month that the fund won’t sell its shares “cheaply.” A Baillie Gifford spokesperson said on Friday that McCombie has nothing to add to these comments. Story continues An offer price of less than 800 pence is unlikely to be accepted, and REA may need to improve it even if it turns hostile by appealing directly to Rightmove shareholders, according to a BI report this week. REA is among a small number of companies suited to buying Rightmove. US real estate firm CoStar Group Inc. purchased rival property portal OnTheMarket Plc for about £100 million last year, while private equity investor Silver Lake Management already owns Zoopla Ltd., effectively ruling them both out of a deal. By keeping its doors closed to REA, Rightmove has already managed to extract a quick succession of sweeteners from its suitor. The risk for Rightmove’s shareholders is that REA walks away and shares in the UK company slump. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Rightmove’s receipt of REA’s fourth takeover proposal — worth 775p a share (based on REA’s closing price on Sept. 27) plus an additional special dividend of 6p a share — is still likely to be rejected by the former’s board and shareholders. We maintain the view that only an offer above 800 pence is likely to sway acceptance. — Tom Ward, BI analyst --With assistance from Joe Easton. (Adds market context from second paragraph.)

Apax managing partner David Su on impact investing | McKinsey Skip to main content Apax global impact managing partner David Su on impact investing September 27, 2024 | Podcast David Su shares his perspectives on the evolution of impact investing and the importance of measurement. He also discusses portfolio company Swing Education to illustrate Apax’s philosophy. Global private equity advisory firm Apax Partners has a long history of prioritizing sustainability and responsible investing. In 2011, it was an early signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investing. In 2012, the firm began collecting and reporting on portfolio company sustainability KPIs, and in 2013, the firm released its first annual sustainability report to investors. 1 Sustainability report edition 11 , Apax Partners, 2023. Today, the firm monitors more than 140 impact indicators in areas such as carbon baselining, decarbonization planning, board diversity, workforce safety, and antibribery. In 2021, the firm launched the Apax Global Impact (AGI) fund. Sir Ronald Cohen, cofounder of Apax and one of the pioneers of impact investing, now chairs AGIâs advisory board. AGIâs first fund closed in December 2023 with about $900 million invested. In this episode of Deal Volume , McKinseyâs podcast on private markets, host and McKinsey partner Brian Vickery speaks with David Su, a managing partner and cohead of the impact investing team at Apax. The two discuss the evolution of impact investing, the importance of measuring impact, the case of AGI portfolio company Swing Education, and a key lesson for impact investors to keep in mind. An edited version of their conversation follows. Impact investing is evolving Brian Vickery: How has the impact market evolved, and where is investor interest coming from today? David Su: The industry has evolved in several ways. First, there were sector exclusions. Traditional private equity funds would avoid certain sectors such as tobacco, firearms, and gaming. Next, investors set minimum ESG [environmental, social, and governance] standards for companies. Today, thereâs been a fundamental shift to investing intentionally in companies that are directly tackling ESG issues. Some funds, such as climate-specific funds, are narrowly focused, while others, including ours, are broader. But we all align with customers, employees, and founders in our interest in mission-driven companies. Businesses with strong sustainability characteristics also get premiums in the public markets. Structural support for sustainable businessesâfor example, lower-cost financing and regulationâprovides strong tailwinds, creating a self-reinforcing flywheel. Brian Vickery: How would you characterize the LPs who invest in impact funds? David Su: There are two types of LPs. The first type either has sleeves for impact investing or has transitioned their entire fund to focus on impact investing. These LPs firmly believe we can simultaneously generate market rate returns and material and measurable impact outcomes. The second type may primarily be drawn to our platform strategyâfor example, our sector focus or our middle market focusâbut it also happens to have an impact lens. Brian Vickery: The broader fundraising environment has been very challenging for the past 18 months or more. How is that affecting the impact-investing market? David Su: Although the overall fundraising environment is tough, authentic impact funds with a strong measurement system and a differentiated platform are getting fundraising dollars. We also see tailwinds from the firms that are transitioning their entire portfolios to impact investing. Measurement helps ensure accountability Brian Vickery: Youâre quite passionate about the ability to measure impact. What does measurement mean to you? David Su: Our measurement system is central to our impact investment strategy. It subjects the impact of each of our investments to the same level of scrutiny as risk in return. We spent more than six months with our advisory board developing a proprietary system that incorporates impact into every stage of our investment process. Itâs simple, evidence-based, and adaptable because we are in the early innings of impact investing, and everybody is still learning. It starts with calculating a companyâs âthreshold scoreâ to determine whether it is making the defined minimum level of impact required by our portfolio. Only companies with a score of 60 or higher (out of 100) are accepted. Once a company is in the portfolio, we calculate an impact improvement scoreâbroken down into scale of impact and the depth of impactâto measure the impact it would generate over four years of investment. We work with the management team to determine those targets and look to tie management and company bonuses and compensation to those targets. We also tie some of our own compensation to the impact improvement score. We set KPIs and hold ourselves accountable on an annual basis. Brian Vickery: How do CEOs of portfolio companies relate to the measurement system? Do they view it as another layer of bureaucracy coming down from private equity? David Su: So far, all our portfolio companies have welcomed it with open arms. And it isnât only the management teams; employees like to see that we are a legitimate impact fund that cares about its mission. Swing Education exemplifies impact investing Brian Vickery: Can you share an example of a portfolio company the AGI fund has invested in? David Su: Swing Education is a great example. Swing is an online marketplace that connects substitute teachers with schoolsâan Uber for substitute teachers, if you will. We all remember a teacher being out sick and the principal or a gym teacher coming into the classroom and putting on a movie. Unsurprisingly, student outcomes are better if a substitute teacher is actually teaching the coursework. Swing is focused on filling absentee days with real teaching days. Additionally, more than 50 percent of substitute teachers have never taught before. Swing is alleviating teacher shortages by recruiting folks from the community and providing them with a pathway to becoming a substitute classroom teacher. Swing checked all the boxes for us from a business and financial underwriting perspective. It is a technology company disrupting legacy staffing providers with a high-quality business model and online marketplace, and it has an exceptional management team. From an impact standpoint, research has extensively proved that more teaching days lead to better student outcomes. Swing is also increasing the teacher supply pool. We worked with Swingâs management team to develop the KPIs we are targeting over the hold period. The scale impact KPIs are increases in the numbers of days filled by Swing substitutes, which equates to more teaching days. The second KPI is the number of new teachers added to the platform or increases in teacher supply. The depth metrics weâre focused on improving are filled-day reliability and quality. For reliability, we measure the percentage of substitutes that showed up compared with those canceling or not showing up. And for quality, we measure whether the school had a positive or negative experience for each filled day. Look for the negative externalities Brian Vickery: What have you learned about impact investing that might help others who are newer to this space? David Su: The biggest lesson is that weâre still in the early days of impact investing. We have a lot of discussions on the total impact of companies and on the negative externalities. For example, we were looking at a medical-products company that makes urinary-incontinence collection bags. And although the products have a large, positive impact on patients, the bags are made out of plastic and other polymers, so we focused on the negative externalities of the materials. A traditional private equity fund wouldnât have that discussion. David Su is a managing partner and cohead of the impact investing team at Apax Partners.

Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Kitwave Group plc (LON:KITW)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 9:27 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: With its stock down 1.6% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Kitwave Group (LON:KITW). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Kitwave Group's ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Kitwave Group How Is ROE Calculated? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Kitwave Group is: 21% = UK£18m ÷ UK£85m (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every £1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn £0.21 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Kitwave Group's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE At first glance, Kitwave Group seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 15% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Kitwave Group's exceptional 40% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. We then compared Kitwave Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 17% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Kitwave Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Kitwave Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? The three-year median payout ratio for Kitwave Group is 45%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 55%. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Kitwave Group is reinvesting its earnings efficiently. Moreover, Kitwave Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of three years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 41%. Conclusion Overall, we are quite pleased with Kitwave Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

There was a moment of grace on Tuesday for investors, market analysts, and finance's top brass when Beijing announced measures to try to reinvigorate China's croaking economy. Pan Gongsheng, a governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, announced that 800 billion yuan, or about $114 billion, would be injected into the stock market. Policymakers also said they were discussing raising a fund designed to stabilize stocks and announced rules allowing Chinese banks to keep less money in reserve, freeing up 1 trillion yuan to go out asloans. They also lowered the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending rate and key interest rates for banks and customers. Homebuyers can also now put less money down on their purchases — an attempt to breathe life into China's moribund property market. The immediate reaction from Wall Street was all-out jubilee. Since the pandemic, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has done little to stop the bleeding in the country's property market or to get China's ailing consumers to start spending money again. The Shanghai Composite lost nearly a quarter of its value. American companies in China are getting crushed . Foreign investors are pulling record amounts of money out of the country. This week's announcements sent Wall Street into a state of rapture, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party is now, as in years past, prepared to catch a falling knife. The Golden Dragon index — a collection of Nasdaq-traded companies that do most of their business in China — rallied 9% following the announcements. Financial-news talking heads heralded this as a clear sign from Beijing that policymakers were getting real about stopping China's descent into a deflationary funk. There would be more mergers and acquisitions! Lower rates could mean more private-equity activity! The famous Beijing "bazooka" could finally be on the way! Advertisement But honey, they are delusional. Xi's Beijing lacks the will and the power to turn China's economy around. At the heart of its problems is a lack of consumer demand and a property market going through a deep, slow-moving correction. Xi is ideologically opposed to jump-starting consumer spending with direct stimulus checks. No will. As for the power, Goldman Sachs estimated that returning China's apartment inventory to 2018 levels would require 7.7 trillion yuan. China's property market is so overbuilt and indebted that the trillions in stimulus needed to fix the problem — and make the local governments that financed it whole again — would make even a rapacious fundraiser like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman blush . The "stimulus" China's policymakers are offering is a drop in a well, and they know that. Wall Street should too. But I guess they haven't learned. The measures the CCP announced are intended to make it easier for Chinese people to access capital and buy property, but access to debt is not the problem here. People in the country do not want to spend money because they are already sitting on large amounts of real-estate debt tied to declining properties. Seventy percent of Chinese household wealth is invested in property, which is a problem since analysts at Société Genéralé found that housing prices have fallen by as much as 30% in Tier 1 cities since their 2021 peak. Land purchases helped fund local governments so they could spend on schools, hospitals, and other social services — now that financing mechanism is out of whack. Sinking prices in these sectors, or what economists call deflation, has spread to the wider economy. The latest consumer price inflation report showed that prices rose by just 0.3% in August compared to the year before, the lowest price growth in three years, prompting concerns that deflation will take hold, spreading to wages and killing jobs. It's clear that Beijing's recent moves won't solve China's core economic problems. Given that context, many Chinese people are not eager to spend. Consumers are trading down to cheaper products , and second-quarter retail sales grew by only 2.7% from the previous year. In a recent note to clients, the business surveyor China Beige Book said that business borrowing had barely budged since all-time lows in 2021, during the depths of the pandemic. Bottom line: It doesn't matter how cheap and easy it is to access loans if no one wants to take one out. Advertisement "These mostly supply-side measures would certainly be helpful if the problem in China was that production was struggling to keep up with growth in demand," Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University and a Carnegie Endowment fellow, said in a recent post on X. "But with weak demand as the main constraint, these measures are more likely to boost the trade surplus than GDP growth." The most direct way to spur demand in a deflating economy is to send checks to households. But again, Xi doesn't want to do that . The Chinese president is a follower of the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek , who believed that direct stimulus distorts markets and leads to uncontrollable inflation. This flies in the face of what economists would recommend for China's situation, but those who criticize the way Xi does things tend to disappear . It's clear that Beijing's recent moves won't solve China's core economic problems. And Wall Street's excitement misses another key problem: The measures aren't even all that big. Call it a bazooka or a blitz or whatever, but this stimulus is tiny compared with what we've seen from the CCP in the past. In 2009, the government dropped 7.6 trillion yuan to save the economy during the global financial crisis. In 2012, it dropped $157 billion on infrastructure projects. In 2015, it injected over $100 billion into ailing regional banks and devalued its currency to boost flagging exports . The CCP has shown that it's willing to take dramatic action to stabilize the economy. The price of that action, though, is massive debt built up all over the financial system, held especially by property companies, state-owned enterprises, and local governments. In the past, monetary easing calmed gyrations in the financial system, but growth has never been this slow, and debt has never been this high. The problem does not match the price tag here. The Chinese Communist Party has a bubble on its hands, and it doesn't want to blow much more or see it burst in spectacular fashion. Plus, there's Xi, who seems fairly uninterested in restructuring the property market. He wants government investment to focus on developing frontier technology and boosting exports to grow the economy out of its structural debt problems. But those new streams of income have yet to materialize for China, and establishing them will take time and working through trade conflict, principally with the US and the European Union. Consider the easing measures we're seeing as something like a moment for markets to catch their breath — a respite from what has been a constant stream of bad economic news. But a respite is all it is. Linette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Business Insider.

One theme in many of the products we're about to launch -- News Feed, Timeline, Open Graph -- is that people love nice big photos. A lot of the time people don't even understand how the new News Feed or Timeline work, but they love those products because of the bigger and richer photos. While this is nice in the short term, I view this as a big strategic risk for us if we don't completely own the photos space. If Instagram continues to kick ass on mobile or if Google buys them, then over the next few years they could easily add pieces of their service that copy what we're doing now, and if they have a growing number of people's photos then that's a real issue for us. They're growing extremely quickly right now. It seems like they double every couple of months or so, and their base is already ~5-10m users. As soon as we launch a compelling product a lot of people will use ours more and future Instagram users will find no reason to use them. But at the current rate, literally every couple of months that we waste translates to a double in their growth and a harder position for us to work our way out of. I get that there are also team issues and we'll need to work through those, but if there are actually people available who could build this more quickly then I think we'd be crazy not to do that. I don't know if there are actually people available or what the costs of that would be though, so it's hard to give you a clear answer here. The message I got from your note though was that you care more about fixing the team than shipping the app. I think we need to do both, but I do think it's a crisis that we don't have a mobile photos app out and I'd prioritize pushing that out as much as possible. Getting the team to a good state is not a milestone by itself that I care about. Separately, I just don't understand why this app is so hard to build. It basically seems like a camera view, some filters, controls for deleting/tagging/captioning your photos, integration into a composer that already exists, and a skin for a photos feed whose infrastructure should already exist. We've had designs that I've been fine with for months. The only piece that seems technically new for us is the filters, but it seems like we're doing okay on those now after a long parallel track. What is so hard about the camera view, feed filters and composer integration? Are we building other unnecessary features? I guess my basic point is this: I get that your team has issues, so fix them and ship the app. I don't see why this should be so hard, and I don't think we should accept any excuses for not getting this done in a short period of time.

As some of you know, we have been interested in this company for some time, but have been pursuing a "build-it-ourselves" strategy. Our interest became more acute after learning that Microsoft has already made a serious offer. The team believes that this is an important transaction for us, for both offensive and defensive reasons. I have attached the deal review presentation for Project Liberty discussed at EMG. I have also provided a quick summary below of the background to the deal as well as our and Microsoft's potential rationale for acquiring DoubleClick. We have heard from reliable sources that that Microsoft has made a bid in the $1.8B to $2.0B range. This weekend we plan to make a competitive bid by means of a non-binding term sheet/indication of interest. Of course, we will come back to you for formal approval as the process unfolds. Background: EMG has given approval to pursue the acquisition of DoubleClick, the leading online ad serving company. Hellman Friedman and JMI Equity began shopping DoubleClick early last week after receiving an indication of interest from Microsoft. Google product, engineering and corporate development teams met last week with Double Click management for preliminary due diligence. Acquisition price is expected to be at least $2B, based on Microsoft's current bid of near $2B (a Microsoft executive told a friend of the company they they were buying Liberty for $2B). We expect that the seller will prefer cash. The process is moving quickly. Google's Rationale for Acquiring DoubleClick: Own DoubleClick's customer footprint to accelerate time to market for our own advertiser and publisher ad serving products Acquisition of DoubleClick by Microsoft would make it very challenging for us to win customers for our own advertiser ad server, which would impair our opportunities in the brand ad market A Microsoft-owned DoubleClick represents a major competitive threat to our AdSense for Content business (see Microsoft Rationale below) Microsoft’s Potential Rationale for Acquiring DoubleClick: Access remnant inventory from Doubleclick's publisher ad server customer base to quickly scale its ad network. Use DoubleClick's advertiser ad server position to harm Yahoo!'s business, driving down its valuation ahead of a potential acquisition (as relayed by Microsoft executive to friend of Google).

Jim Grant says Warren Buffett is warning us about US stocks by pivoting to this 1 asset class. Should you? Read full article Jing Pan Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:01 PM 5 min read Link Copied 121 In this article: Jim Grant says Warren Buffett is warning us about US stocks by pivoting to this 1 asset class. Should you? Momentum in the U.S. stock market appears relentless. After a remarkable 24% surge in the S&P 500 in 2023, the index has climbed another 20% in 2024, despite some temporary setbacks earlier in the year. Amid this bullish backdrop, Jim Grant, editor of “Grant’s Interest Rate Observer,” issued a pointed caution for investors. Don't miss Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how “We shouldn't forget that it is at an all time [high], almost everything, price [to] earnings, price [to] book, price [to] sales, what have you, and nor should we forget that the greatest equity investor is about ready to show a balance sheet that's 50-50, with more T-bills than stocks,” he said in an interview with Fox Business. Grant was alluding to investing legend Warren Buffett, implying that Buffett’s pivot toward safer assets like Treasury bills — short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with maturities of one year or less — may be a red flag for investors. “When the greatest equity investor owns more bills than equities, one at least is advised to step back and say, if this is perfection, how does it improve?” Grant warned, suggesting that investors consider the potential risks of an overheated market. Buffett’s cash reserve Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stakes in several major holdings this year. For instance, in Q2, Berkshire sold 389 million shares of its top holding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), cutting its position by 49.3%. It also reduced its stake in Capital One (NYSE:COF) by 21.3%, offloading 2.65 million shares. Additionally, a more recent filing reveals that Berkshire trimmed its stake in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) down to 10.5% in Q3. While Berkshire did make some purchases in Q2, it sold far more than it bought, marking the seventh consecutive quarter as a net seller of stocks. As a result, the company is sitting on a substantial cash reserve. As of June 30, 2024, Berkshire’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills totaled $271.5 billion. What’s particularly noteworthy is the vast amount Berkshire has allocated to Treasury bills. By the end of June, Berkshire held a whopping $234.618 billion in Treasury bills. Story continues That’s more than the U.S. Federal Reserve's Treasury bill holdings, which stood at $195.293 billion as of September 25. Still, Buffett held a larger position in stocks. As of the end of June, Berkshire’s investments in equity securities totaled $284.871 billion, reflecting its continued substantial exposure to the stock market. Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead Why is Buffett holding so much cash? Berkshire's massive cash position has sparked questions about why Buffett isn’t seizing more investment opportunities. After all, as Grant noted, Buffett is often hailed as the world’s greatest investor. From 1964 to 2023, Berkshire achieved an extraordinary overall gain of 4,384,748%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 31,223% over the same period. Buffett has addressed the cash concern, explaining his cautious approach during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year. “I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated , emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.” Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.” While some see Berkshire’s cash hoard as a defensive stance against a potential market downturn, others interpret it differently. Fund manager Chris Bloomstran told Business Insider that the situation is more nuanced. He noted that Berkshire’s large insurance operations necessitate a substantial cash reserve to cover potential payouts. Moreover, given Berkshire’s size, its range of suitable investments is limited. Bloomstran pointed out that with Treasury bills offering decent yields, Buffett can afford to be patient. “He's limited to maybe the 100 biggest companies in the S&P 500 and maybe a handful of international businesses to be able to invest in,” Bloomstran explained. “So, his opportunity set is expensive, but he doesn't mind earning 5.3% in the interim, but it does not mean in any way, shape, or form that a stock market crash is imminent. He's just trying to find great prices stable enough to put money to work. His universe is limited.” Of course, financial prudence has always been a cornerstone of Buffett’s philosophy. In his recent letter to shareholders, Buffett emphasized that Berkshire “holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill position far in excess of what conventional wisdom deems necessary.” This conservative approach could prove to be a significant advantage during times of financial turmoil. Buffett highlighted that during the 2008 financial crisis, Berkshire generated cash through its operations, without relying on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets in any capacity. “We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis, but we were always prepared for one,” Buffett said, underscoring the importance of maintaining liquidity in uncertain times.

The article discusses Jim Grant's cautionary stance on the US stock market, citing Warren Buffett's pivot towards safer assets like Treasury bills as a potential red flag for investors. This shift in investment strategy, along with Berkshire Hathaway's significant reduction in stock holdings and substantial cash reserve, indicates concerns about market overheating and potential risks. The focus on financial prudence, liquidity, and the conservative approach of Buffett suggests a sentiment leaning towards significant fears of an impending recession. The confidence score is moderate due to the clear information provided in the article regarding Buffett

Traders Blow Off US Election Risks as Stocks Race Into October Read full article 1 / 4 Traders Blow Off US Election Risks as Stocks Race Into October Jessica Menton Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 1:00 PM 5 min read Link Copied 7 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- US stocks survived what’s traditionally their toughest stretch of the year, and investors expect the rally to keep running in October despite a contentious presidential election campaign, shifting Federal Reserve policy and fears of a pending recession. Most Read from Bloomberg A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC The S&P 500 Index just posted its third straight winning week and is up 5.1% in the third quarter, putting it on track for its best start to a year since 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also has pushed the benchmark’s market capitalization above $50 trillion for the first time. And oddly enough, it all happened in September, which historically is the stock market’s worst month. The gains were accomplished for the most part without the help of the Big Tech companies that have provided so much growth for so long. Indeed, the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index is up just 1.7% for the quarter, while the equal-weight version of the S&P 500 has jumped nearly 9%. Meaning, the recent rise has largely been broad based, fueled by hopes that the Fed will engineer a soft landing with interest-rate cuts that started earlier this month. From here, the question is can the rally continue through next month and into year-end — and if so, what will it look like? Based on positioning data, few traders and investors seem worried enough to bother hedging after playing defense in the early part of the summer. “I’m really bullish on stocks,” said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth, who sees the S&P 500 ending 2024 at 6,000, a roughly 4.6% bump from Friday’s close. “The chip rally has paused, and people have taken notice. But Big Tech and semis will lead this market higher in the fourth quarter.” Her intuition is backed by hedge fund trading, which shows nearly three times as many bets that information technology stocks will rise than bets that they will fall, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s prime brokerage desk report. Economic Risk Of course, there are reasons to be concerned. The Fed is trying to engineer a soft landing after a period of rapid inflation and aggressive rate hikes, an effort that’s rarely successful. In addition, the probability of a recession in the next 12 months remains elevated, according to the New York Fed. Story continues “Friday’s jobs report will be crucial because that will give us more indication on the economy and how much the Fed will cut rates at its next meeting,” Bartels said. That said, consensus expectations are for economic growth to remain steady. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real gross domestic product climbing at a 3.1% annual rate in the third quarter, up from 3% in the second quarter. Options positioning shows similar optimism. The five-day moving average for the equity put-to-call ratio, which rises as bearish bets increase, is near 0.51, its lowest level since July 2023. This year’s stock market rally has defied skeptics ever since growth jitters sent equities spiraling into their worst selloff of the year in the first week of September. It also came without much help from Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the artificial-intelligence boom that’s powered the nearly two-year bull run in stocks but stalled out this summer. The savior for investors has been the rally broadening beyond megacap tech. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index is on pace to beat the regular market-cap weighted version of the benchmark in the third quarter by the most since the final three months of 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chip Bulls That mini-slump is why Rich Ross, head of technical analysis at Evercore ISI, is bullish on semiconductor stocks in the fourth quarter, particularly after Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, delivered a surprisingly strong sales forecast. He sees the $253 billion VanEck Semiconductor Exchange-Traded Fund, which includes chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Micron and Broadcom Inc., climbing another 20% by year-end after rising 45% through the first three quarters. “A rally in tech stocks should be positive for the market’s upward momentum,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors, whose firm is adding exposure to small cap stocks as well as industrials, materials and energy companies. “But if it comes at the expense of breadth, I wouldn’t take that as a healthy sign.” Very short-dated options over the next few weeks appear expensive given that the S&P 500 is at records and there’s a lack of strong catalysts, such as key economic data or earnings releases. But contracts that look a bit further out are pricing in a slew of events that have the potential to whipsaw markets. In a span of six weeks, investors will contend with two crucial jobs reports, a blitz of earnings from some of America’s biggest companies, the US presidential election on Nov. 5, and then the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Nov. 7. Traders are split on the size of the next rate cut, with swaps markets pricing in increasing odds of another half-point reduction. There are risks to either approach. “If they were to continue at a pace of only 25 basis points, given the trajectory of the economy, we think that that would raise the risk of a recession next year,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. That said, he still sees the S&P 500 reaching 6,000 by year-end. “With a growing expectation for a soft landing in the economy, there’s nowhere else for stocks to go.” --With assistance from Alexandra Semenova and Brad Skillman.

Is Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) Trading At A 26% Discount? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 11:18 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights The projected fair value for Aristocrat Leisure is AU$78.97 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Aristocrat Leisure's AU$58.17 share price signals that it might be 26% undervalued The AU$55.03 analyst price target for ALL is 30% less than our estimate of fair value Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Aristocrat Leisure Limited ( ASX:ALL ) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model . Check out our latest analysis for Aristocrat Leisure Crunching The Numbers We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (A$, Millions) AU$1.63b AU$1.82b AU$2.00b AU$2.23b AU$2.40b AU$2.55b AU$2.68b AU$2.79b AU$2.89b AU$2.99b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 7.72% Est @ 6.13% Est @ 5.01% Est @ 4.23% Est @ 3.69% Est @ 3.30% Present Value (A$, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% AU$1.5k AU$1.6k AU$1.6k AU$1.7k AU$1.7k AU$1.7k AU$1.7k AU$1.6k AU$1.6k AU$1.5k ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = AU$16b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%. Story continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$3.0b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.4%) = AU$66b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = AU$66b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%) 10 = AU$33b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$50b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$58.2, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Aristocrat Leisure as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.124. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Aristocrat Leisure Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Hospitality industry. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market. Opportunity Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the Australian market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the Australian market. Next Steps: Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Marks and Spencer Group Crunching The Numbers We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (£, Millions) UK£372.9m UK£402.1m UK£697.5m UK£493.0m UK£505.0m UK£514.9m UK£525.0m UK£535.2m UK£545.6m UK£556.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.97% Est @ 1.96% Est @ 1.95% Est @ 1.94% Est @ 1.94% Present Value (£, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% UK£351 UK£356 UK£582 UK£387 UK£373 UK£358 UK£344 UK£330 UK£317 UK£304 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK£3.7b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = UK£556m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.2%– 1.9%) = UK£13b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = UK£13b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%) 10 = UK£7.2b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is UK£11b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK£3.8, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf Important Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marks and Spencer Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.885. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Marks and Spencer Group Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market. Shareholders have been diluted in the past year. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the British market. Moving On: Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of IRIS Corporation Berhad (KLSE:IRIS) Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Sep 28, 2024, 2:28 AM 6 min read Link Copied 0 Key Insights The projected fair value for IRIS Corporation Berhad is RM0.44 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of RM0.36 suggests IRIS Corporation Berhad is potentially trading close to its fair value The average premium for IRIS Corporation Berhad's competitors is currently 730% In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of IRIS Corporation Berhad ( KLSE:IRIS ) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for IRIS Corporation Berhad The Calculation We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (MYR, Millions) RM28.1m RM26.9m RM26.4m RM26.3m RM26.5m RM26.9m RM27.5m RM28.3m RM29.1m RM30.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -7.74% Est @ -4.35% Est @ -1.98% Est @ -0.32% Est @ 0.84% Est @ 1.65% Est @ 2.22% Est @ 2.62% Est @ 2.90% Est @ 3.09% Present Value (MYR, Millions) Discounted @ 9.9% RM25.6 RM22.3 RM19.9 RM18.0 RM16.5 RM15.3 RM14.2 RM13.3 RM12.4 RM11.7 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM169m Story continues The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.9%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = RM30m× (1 + 3.6%) ÷ (9.9%– 3.6%) = RM488m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = RM488m÷ ( 1 + 9.9%) 10 = RM190m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM359m. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of RM0.4, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf The Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IRIS Corporation Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.140. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Next Steps: Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

A critical labor report meets a stock market at record highs: What to know this week Read full article Josh Schafer · Reporter Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:30 PM 7 min read Link Copied 666 In this article: Stocks drifted higher over the past week, with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) notching several record closes as investors digested more signs of cooling inflation amid resilient economic growth data. For the week, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) were up about 0.7%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) popped nearly 1%. In the week ahead, the September jobs report is expected to provide further clues on how quickly the labor market is cooling. Updates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar. On a company level, a deliveries update from Tesla ( TSLA ) and quarterly results from Nike ( NKE ) will be in focus. All eyes on labor The most recent reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continue to cool toward the Fed's 2% goal , putting further focus on the Fed's other mandate: maximum employment. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference on Sept. 18 that the labor market is currently in "solid condition" and the central bank is cutting interest rates, in part, to keep it that way. Still, there's been a clear slowdown in the labor market. The unemployment rate has steadily crept up in 2024 and sits at 4.2% , near its highest level in almost three years. Meanwhile, job gains have slowed, with the US economy recording two of its lowest monthly job additions of 2024. And job openings in July were at their lowest level since January 2021 . The pressing question as the release of the September jobs report on Friday morning approaches is just how quickly this slowdown in the labor market is taking place. Consensus expectations on Wall Street point to more signs of a gradual cooling rather than a rapid slowdown. The September jobs report is expected to show 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In August, the US economy added 142,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2%. Entering the labor market data dump, the most recent print on weekly jobless claims showed weekly unemployment claims were at a four-month low for the week ending Sept. 21. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients Friday that the consistently low layoff numbers suggest that "September employment report should be decent." "The labor market is the biggest risk to our outlook," Bhave wrote. "Layoffs are the key indicator to watch: as long as they stay low, the base case will likely remain a soft landing." Story continues A construction worker takes a break from work under an American flag in Malibu on July 3. (Getty Images) (Genaro Molina via Getty Images) Best foot forward? Retail giant Nike is expected to report its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Wall Street is expecting the sports apparel brand to report quarterly revenue of $11.65 billion with earnings per share of $0.52. Both metrics would represent year-over-year declines from the same quarter a year ago as the company battles to reinvigorate revenue growth. The release will mark Nike's first earnings report since it announced Elliott Hill, a former Nike executive who retired in 2020, will replace John Donahoe as CEO on Oct. 14. The announcement came as Nike shares had fallen about 25% on the year. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez wrote in a note to clients that the implications of Hill's return and the turnaround strategy at Nike will be the key focus of the earnings call. "We believe [management] likely lowers full-year 2025 guidance on weakening China macro and brand reset in that [market], as well as more conservative assumptions tied to the planned innovation-driven sales acceleration in the second half of 2025," Lejuez wrote. Tesla talk Tesla stock has been quietly rallying, with shares rising more than 24% over the past month and officially turning back positive for the year. While that move has come from little news, the fundamental story for Tesla will once again be in focus during the week ahead. The electric vehicle maker is expected to announce its third quarter delivery numbers. Analysts expect Tesla delivered about 462,000 cars in the quarter, up from 443,956 in the prior quarter and a 6% increase from the sales seen in the same quarter a year ago. The company's highly anticipated robotaxi reveal is slated for Oct. 10. Investors look for 'growth' Stocks have largely chugged higher since the Federal Reserve opted for a larger interest rate cut at its most recent meeting. Investors appear to have accepted the Fed was cutting the benchmark rate by half a percentage point to preserve a currently healthy economy rather than to provide aid to a flailing one. Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance this scenario where the Fed isn't cutting because the economy needs it is "hugely bullish" for equities. "Everything is about the growth side of the economy and everything is about the consumer," Kaiser said. "Any data that suggests consumer spending is holding in and you're not seeing the weakness that people are worried about and that the Fed is worried about, I think that's all going to be positive for equity markets." Subsequently, a bad jobs report on Friday could have the opposite impact on stocks. "If it turns out that they started cutting because they're legitimately concerned about weakness in the labor market, rate cuts aren't going to be enough to help equities in that case and you're going to trade lower," Kaiser said. "So the why [the Fed is cutting] matters here. And payrolls is going to help answer that." Kaiser's comments call back to a chart Ritholtz Wealth Management's chief market strategist Callie Cox shared in the summer edition of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook . Cox pointed out that the S&P 500 has had varying reaction rate cuts throughout the years. Usually, whether or not the economy enters a recession is a key driver of those returns. As Cox's work shows, only once has the S&P 500 been lower a year after rate cuts start when the economy skirts recession.

Himax Technologies, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HIMX) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financial Prospects Look Decent: Is The Market Wrong? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 1:37 PM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) has had a rough three months with its share price down 28%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study Himax Technologies' ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Himax Technologies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Himax Technologies is: 8.8% = US$76m ÷ US$864m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Himax Technologies' Earnings Growth And 8.8% ROE When you first look at it, Himax Technologies' ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. Himax Technologies was still able to see a decent net income growth of 19% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. As a next step, we compared Himax Technologies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 24% in the same period. past-earnings-growth The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Himax Technologies fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Himax Technologies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? With a three-year median payout ratio of 50% (implying that the company retains 50% of its profits), it seems that Himax Technologies is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered. Besides, Himax Technologies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 53%. Still, forecasts suggest that Himax Technologies' future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much. Conclusion On the whole, we do feel that Himax Technologies has some positive attributes. Namely, its respectable earnings growth, which it achieved due to it retaining most of its profits. However, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

Guidance for FY 2024-2025: Expected EBITDA of EUR120 million to EUR160 million. Net Debt Guidance: Expected to be no more than EUR190 million by year-end FY 2024-2025. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with XTER:VBK. Release Date: September 26, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript. Positive Points Verbio SE ( XTER:VBK ) achieved record production volumes, exceeding 1 million tonnes of liquid biofuels and 1.1 terawatt hours of RNG. The company increased CO2 savings for customers by 1 million tonnes to 4.4 million tonnes. Significant progress in scaling technology abroad, with Nevada running on small volumes and South Bend Indiana increasing production availability by 20%. Groundbreaking ceremony for a new speciality chemicals facility in Bitterfeld, tapping into a promising market. Launch of a trading unit in Geneva to better manage global flow of goods and feedstocks. Negative Points EBITDA for 2023-2024 was EUR121.6 million, below initial expectations of EUR200 million to EUR250 million. Continued pressure from fraudulent Chinese biodiesel imports impacted results. Net debt increased to EUR32.9 million due to growth investments of more than EUR180 million. Lower greenhouse gas quota prices and premiums negatively impacted earnings. Ramp-up costs in the United States affected the bioethanol and biomethane segment's EBITDA, which fell year-over-year. Q & A Highlights Q : Last year you highlighted that US activities were still not accretive to your group margins. What is the outlook for the new fiscal year now that the Nevada plant is ramping up and South Bend keeps improving? A : (Olaf Troeber, CFO) We expect South Bend to further improve due to increased production. Our technical team has done a great job increasing capacity utilization. For Nevada, we expect an EBITDA of zero for the financial year, starting with a negative EBITDA in the first and second quarters and moving towards a positive EBITDA in the third and fourth quarters. Q : Could you share the key assumptions in terms of ethanol, biodiesel spreads, greenhouse gas quota prices in Germany, and natural gas prices in Europe at the midpoint of your EBITDA guidance? A : (Olaf Troeber, CFO) We currently face healthy bioethanol margins in the US, with higher margins during the driving season. In Canada, we have a matching contract in place. For biodiesel in Europe, we incorporated the high margins we are currently experiencing but took a more cautious approach for the third and fourth quarters. For bioethanol in Europe, we expect stable margins with slightly higher ethanol prices. We also anticipate an increase in greenhouse gas quota prices from EUR120. Q : Can you update us on the ongoing negotiations about enhanced certification on biodiesel imports from Asia? Is that a feasible scenario to avoid new fraudulent volumes? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) There will be something for sure, but the details and how to implement it will be discussed in spring 2025. The draft from Friday helps us now by preventing the surplus from 2024 from rolling into 2025 and 2026. Q : What is the level of CapEx assumed for the new year to reach the net debt guidance set for the new fiscal year? A : (Olaf Troeber, CFO) The average CapEx for the next three years will be approximately EUR140 million, with up to EUR200 million in investments for this year. We provided a net debt figure of up to EUR190 million due to liquidity fluctuations. Q : What are your expectations regarding the EU tariffs on biodiesel? Are they going to come under fire or remain in place, and how do you see the impact? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) The antidumping duties help but do not solve the problem. We need mechanisms to control imports and ensure that biodiesel is made from the feedstock stated on the certificate. We need stable regulation and more focus on compliance. Q : Why do you expect higher margins from the US market and lower margins in Europe? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) In Europe, we were cautious due to oversupply. In the US, we expect record corn harvests, leading to cheap corn and ethanol. The US is exporting ethanol, and this will continue as long as we have cheap corn. Q : Do you have an expected timing for the draft published last Friday? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) Affected parties can provide feedback until October 1. The target is for the new regulation to be in place by January 1, 2025. We expect the timeline to stay on track, with the draft passing the German parliament in November. Q : Can you provide more detail on the tax credit sale in the US? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) The tax credit was about $40 million, with a single-digit discount. The process was straightforward, and the money is already in our account. Q : Can you provide more color on the expected production ramp-up and contribution of Nevada to results in the current fiscal year '24, '25? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) We aim to reach full utilization by the end of the business year. The ramp-up is slow but will accelerate in spring. South Bend is progressing well, with a 20% capacity increase and reduced costs. South Bend is profitable, and we will start further investments there. Q : What impact do you expect from the political environment in the US, especially with the upcoming elections? A : (Claus Sauter, CEO) We do not expect any negative impact. The IRA benefits the Midwest, which are traditionally Republican states. Our technology provides a competitive advantage, making us less vulnerable to political changes.

Peacock boss Matt Strauss has plans to keep you streaming - The Verge Skip to main content The Verge The Verge logo. The Verge homepage The Verge The Verge logo. Menu Expand Decoder NBCU’s streaming chief isn’t worried about you canceling cable Matt Strauss, head of Peacock and global streaming, has plans to keep you watching. By Nilay Patel , editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast , and co-host of The Vergecast . Sep 30, 2024, 3:00 PM UTC Share this story Threads If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Matt Strauss, who is the chairman of direct-to-consumer at NBCUniversal. That’s a big fancy title that means Matt’s in charge of Peacock and every other streaming video offering the company has worldwide. That includes everything from Fandango and its Fandango at Home service — which used to be Vudu — to Rotten Tomatoes to the core platform that powers the Now TV service run by Sky in Europe. That’s a lot, and all of that is under the overall ownership of Comcast, which is in the middle of its own massive transition as its traditional cable TV business continues to fade away. Matt actually spent almost two decades at Comcast working on its cable products before switching over to NBCU, and I was really interested in his view on how the economics of the TV business will shake out as almost everyone moves to streaming. Listen to Decoder , a show hosted by The Verge ’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here ! Matt also oversees the global streaming platform that Peacock and other services at NBCU run on, and I wanted to know that big tech investment is generating the kind of economies of scale that really pay off over time — stuff that tech companies think about all the time, but media companies have had to learn. One thing I really wanted to talk to Matt about was how Peacock handled the Olympics this year — it felt like things really clicked for the platform in Paris over the summer, and the idea that all the coverage could be served up in multiple different formats on demand and live really worked. It turns out that a lot of these ideas have been brewing for a long time — for a decade or more in some cases. There’s a lot in this one — tech, media, sports, and culture, all at once. It’s quite a ride. Our usual disclosure before we start — NBCU is an investor in The Verge ’s parent company, Vox Media, but they have no control over our newsroom, and I remain free to demand NFL games in 4K HDR of their executives on my show whenever I want. You’re on the hook now, Matt. Okay, Matt Strauss, head of direct-to-consumer at NBCUniversal. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Matt Strauss, you are the chairman of direct-to-consumer at NBCUniversal. Welcome to Decoder . Thank you, Nilay. It’s good to be here. That is a very formal title. It sounds like you sit in a leather chair in a boardroom and just sort of issue edicts. What it means to me is that you oversee Peacock. Is that really the scope of it? It’s a little bit broader than that. To give you a little bit of background, I actually have just celebrated my 20-year anniversary at Comcast, and so I’ve been at the company for quite a long time. And when I came to Comcast, I actually came there as cable was transitioning from analog to digital, and it gave way to the two-way connectivity that ultimately built things like on-demand. On-demand technology is something I’ve been very passionate about my entire career and was really focused on how I built that out for Comcast and spent quite a number of years doing that. We ultimately launched the X1 platform, which was Comcast’s IP set-top box, because we realized that the future was on-demand that was going to give people instant gratification, and we needed a platform to allow people ultimate control, that they could navigate all these on-demand choices, and X1 became the platform where we did that. And it really was ahead of its time because it aggregated live and on-demand and DVR and even apps and made them all really seamless for consumers, including the ability to navigate them with your voice with the voice remote, which was before even Siri and Alexa — like we were experimenting with voice. I think as my career there kind of grew and I took on more of the role of overseeing the residential services at Comcast, which included video and broadband and phone, I got a call one day to come to NBC, which obviously is a subsidiary of Comcast, and I got a call from Steve Burke, who at the time was the CEO, and he had asked if I would come there to help them build a streaming service and take it to market, and I got that call on a Thursday, and on Monday, I showed up in New York City with my suitcase, and I was ready to go. And what’s very common inside of large companies in my experience is that when you’re trying to build something new, it’s common to almost incubate it. You kind of create resources. You put a little bit of a fence around it because you don’t want the day-to-day activity necessarily interfering with the ambition of trying to build a new business, and Peacock was the same inside of NBC. What I realized early on was that there’s lots of other businesses within NBC that actually are very complimentary and can help get us more scale, can help de-risk the execution and the ambition we had with Peacock, for example. NBC owns Fandango, which is one of the largest ticketing companies. They own Voodoo, which is now called Fandango at Home, which has a catalog of 250,000 titles for digital purchase and rental. They own Rotten Tomatoes, which is certainly known for movie and TV reviews. They also — everyone’s familiar with NBC and a lot of the cable networks that we have in the United States, but NBC distributes their networks in almost every country around the world. We recognized that if we could aggregate all of these businesses under one portfolio, it actually could give us even more economies of scale, and that’s what we started to do. And so the umbrella of direct-to-consumers, Peacock is certainly a big piece of it, but all these other businesses — the global businesses and these other digital businesses — now sit under this D2C umbrella, and they each have their own individual P&Ls, but in the aggregate, they reach 100 million users, they generate billions of dollars of revenue, and they also… they’re available in over 70 countries around the world. I think that that is the portfolio that I’m now managing. How we then leverage that portfolio is something that I’ve been trying to build out over the last few years around again, trying to build one product team, one technology team, one decision sciences research team, etc., to give us kind of these centers of excellence inside of NBC as we continue to roll out our digital plans for direct-to-consumer. You’re on Decoder , so I’m absolutely going to ask you about how all of that is structured and how all of those individual P&Ls fight for resources. But I want to just take one step back and focus on the transition you mentioned from Comcast to NBC to direct-to-consumer. In the TV world, we’re broadly going from a place where big cable companies like Comcast or Spectrum or whatever had big regional physical infrastructure monopolies. You had these natural monopolies because you had wires in the ground going to everyone’s houses. You were the distributor, the video providers would come to you and you would resell those services, and that was a pretty good business for everyone. Now we’re at a place where there’s multiple ways to get programming over the internet, whether it’s wireless, whether it’s fiber in the ground, whether it’s still the cable network, whether it’s other forms of broadband like Starlink, and the distributors don’t have as much power over the suppliers because the suppliers can get to consumers in lots of different ways. That’s the transition that you’re mentioning, and it has really disrupted the whole industry. How do you see Peacock fitting into this at the end? Is it going to be as good of a business as the cable business was once upon a time? Because it feels like everyone is searching for a business that good. There’s no question that the cable business is a good business and continues to be a good business . I think to answer the question, you almost need to look at it through the lens of the consumer. And what I’ve learned is there really are different cohorts of how people consume video, how they subscribe to video. So, for example, the cable customer tends to watch a lot of TV. The average consumer watches about five hours a day ; if you subscribe to cable, you typically watch that much, if not more. And there’s a lot of benefit of having cable because, as I mentioned, if you have the X1 platform, there’s a simplicity of just having all the choices in one place. It works with 99.99 percent reliability. In many cases, people are also subscribing to the bundle, so they’re getting video, but then they’re also getting internet, and in some cases, they’re getting their wireless. And even though people tend to say they like a la carte, bundling has a lot of virtue because the more you take, the better the price. People who subscribe to cable and satellite today, it’s not that they’re not aware of other choices — they’re paying in some cases, for that convenience in that reliability. They also tend to over index in subscribing to streaming services. It’s not one or the other. In many cases, you’re seeing that customer buying both. That’s one part of the market. You have another part of the market, which might be more price sensitive, maybe does not consume as much video. In some cases, they might watch video, but they might be spending more time on social media or video gaming or how else they’re occupying their time, and they like the flexibility of being able to subscribe to a subset of services. And in many ways, that’s what direct-to-consumer is offering. There is a Venn diagram, though, here, where as a media company, you want to cast a broad enough net where you’re providing a value proposition for one segment, which is like the content carnivore but, at the same time, offering the optionality, and in some cases, with direct-to-consumer, but in many cases, there’s an overlap between the two. When you look at it as a portfolio, which is really how we manage the business in NBC, it’s not direct-to-consumer sits outside of the broadcast and the linear and the cable networks; it’s actually all one group, and we manage it as a portfolio. And there’s examples where that comes to life like the Olympics, but I think that we are kind of looking at it in totality and that it’s about giving customers choice and options, and that’s how we see ourselves growing. If pay-TV declines and cord cutting grows, we still want to service the customers who have paid TV, but at the same time, we recognize that the growth over the next foreseeable future is going to continue to come from direct-to-consumer. The last time I was a Comcast customer was 15 years ago. I lived in Chicago, and everyone I knew was a Comcast customer. That was the choice in my building and most of the neighborhoods that my friends lived in. We all also got internet from Comcast because of what you’re describing — the bundle. There was not another thing; it was just the easiest next thing to do. When you describe direct-to-consumer, that’s another distribution method, right? You’re going literally directly to the consumer and charging them money and then giving them services directly, and you manage the customer relationship. Is that the part that’s going to grow, versus the experience I had when I was a Comcast customer and I would watch NBC 5 in Chicago, but Comcast owned the relationship with me? I think when you kind of study the pay-TV ecosystem and the trajectory of pay-TV, I think it’s consistently been declining year over year, and I don’t think anybody really knows at what point does it start to flatten out? But I do believe that there’s always going to be a fairly large group of people who are willing to pay a premium for cable for all the reasons that I said before. And so I think that’s still going to be a very, very large part of the TV viewing and TV households viewing. But yes, I mean, direct-to-consumer is where we’re really projecting the growth to come from. I actually think that there’s a lot of signs of what I’ve learned in the cable business that I see happening in the direct-to-consumer business that, in some ways, it’s going to be, I think, back to the future. And what I mean by that is that people who maybe did cut the cord, part of the rationale I believe was because they thought they were going to save money by going and just getting some streaming services. And to a certain extent, that was true for some period of time, but it was very predictable that the cost of content hasn’t gone down, the cost of sports rights haven’t gone down. It was inevitable that prices of streaming services were going to have to increase. And we’ve seen that as an industry over the past 18 to 24 months, where streaming services have continued to take their rates up in an effort to drive more profitability. By the way, we’re not excluded from that. I mean, we took a price increase over the summer. I think that that was a very predictable outcome. The other predictable outcome, from my point of view, is what I said earlier, which is people watch more video than they really know. If you look at the Nielsen numbers, the amount of time that people spend watching video has been fairly consistent over the past decade. If you cut the cord and you sign up for a streaming service, you’re unlikely going to get your video calories as a consumer from one service. What happens is you subscribe to two, three, and now the average consumer is subscribing to four or five services. You take these two things together, where I’m subscribing now to four or five services, the rates are continuing to go up. In some cases, you may be asking yourself: Wait, I might be paying more and possibly getting less than what I got when I subscribed to cable. And I think that these are the ingredients in the marketplace that is driving the market to bundling . And we had talked about this, I had talked about this five years ago that we’re likely going to see an explosion of streaming and direct-to-consumer, only to then find it almost reaggregate itself under a new bundle. And I think there’s obviously a lot of evidence over the last two years where that’s exactly what’s been happening. And I think that, so again, in many ways, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re going to still have people who subscribe to cable or streaming or both, but I think that direct-to-consumer is going to be a very important component, but I think increasingly direct-to-consumer, and direct-to-consumer as part of a bundling construct, is going to likely be how many people over time are subscribing to these different services, which, again, is ironically back to where everything started with cable television. Are you seeing the growth in the bundling, and are you able to maintain the customer relationship as the bundles grow? I’m thinking specifically of my customer relationship with your competitor, Max, which is somehow to this day still mediated by my

There was a moment of grace on Tuesday for investors, market analysts, and finance's top brass when Beijing announced measures to try to reinvigorate China's croaking economy. Pan Gongsheng, a governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, announced that 800 billion yuan, or about $114 billion, would be injected into the stock market. Policymakers also said they were discussing raising a fund designed to stabilize stocks and announced rules allowing Chinese banks to keep less money in reserve, freeing up 1 trillion yuan to go out asloans. They also lowered the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending rate and key interest rates for banks and customers. Homebuyers can also now put less money down on their purchases — an attempt to breathe life into China's moribund property market. The immediate reaction from Wall Street was all-out jubilee. Since the pandemic, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has done little to stop the bleeding in the country's property market or to get China's ailing consumers to start spending money again. The Shanghai Composite lost nearly a quarter of its value. American companies in China are getting crushed . Foreign investors are pulling record amounts of money out of the country. This week's announcements sent Wall Street into a state of rapture, hoping that the Chinese Communist Party is now, as in years past, prepared to catch a falling knife. The Golden Dragon index — a collection of Nasdaq-traded companies that do most of their business in China — rallied 9% following the announcements. Financial-news talking heads heralded this as a clear sign from Beijing that policymakers were getting real about stopping China's descent into a deflationary funk. There would be more mergers and acquisitions! Lower rates could mean more private-equity activity! The famous Beijing "bazooka" could finally be on the way! Advertisement But honey, they are delusional. Xi's Beijing lacks the will and the power to turn China's economy around. At the heart of its problems is a lack of consumer demand and a property market going through a deep, slow-moving correction. Xi is ideologically opposed to jump-starting consumer spending with direct stimulus checks. No will. As for the power, Goldman Sachs estimated that returning China's apartment inventory to 2018 levels would require 7.7 trillion yuan. China's property market is so overbuilt and indebted that the trillions in stimulus needed to fix the problem — and make the local governments that financed it whole again — would make even a rapacious fundraiser like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman blush . The "stimulus" China's policymakers are offering is a drop in a well, and they know that. Wall Street should too. But I guess they haven't learned. The measures the CCP announced are intended to make it easier for Chinese people to access capital and buy property, but access to debt is not the problem here. People in the country do not want to spend money because they are already sitting on large amounts of real-estate debt tied to declining properties. Seventy percent of Chinese household wealth is invested in property, which is a problem since analysts at Société Genéralé found that housing prices have fallen by as much as 30% in Tier 1 cities since their 2021 peak. Land purchases helped fund local governments so they could spend on schools, hospitals, and other social services — now that financing mechanism is out of whack. Sinking prices in these sectors, or what economists call deflation, has spread to the wider economy. The latest consumer price inflation report showed that prices rose by just 0.3% in August compared to the year before, the lowest price growth in three years, prompting concerns that deflation will take hold, spreading to wages and killing jobs. It's clear that Beijing's recent moves won't solve China's core economic problems. Given that context, many Chinese people are not eager to spend. Consumers are trading down to cheaper products , and second-quarter retail sales grew by only 2.7% from the previous year. In a recent note to clients, the business surveyor China Beige Book said that business borrowing had barely budged since all-time lows in 2021, during the depths of the pandemic. Bottom line: It doesn't matter how cheap and easy it is to access loans if no one wants to take one out. Advertisement "These mostly supply-side measures would certainly be helpful if the problem in China was that production was struggling to keep up with growth in demand," Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University and a Carnegie Endowment fellow, said in a recent post on X. "But with weak demand as the main constraint, these measures are more likely to boost the trade surplus than GDP growth." The most direct way to spur demand in a deflating economy is to send checks to households. But again, Xi doesn't want to do that . The Chinese president is a follower of the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek , who believed that direct stimulus distorts markets and leads to uncontrollable inflation. This flies in the face of what economists would recommend for China's situation, but those who criticize the way Xi does things tend to disappear . It's clear that Beijing's recent moves won't solve China's core economic problems. And Wall Street's excitement misses another key problem: The measures aren't even all that big. Call it a bazooka or a blitz or whatever, but this stimulus is tiny compared with what we've seen from the CCP in the past. In 2009, the government dropped 7.6 trillion yuan to save the economy during the global financial crisis. In 2012, it dropped $157 billion on infrastructure projects. In 2015, it injected over $100 billion into ailing regional banks and devalued its currency to boost flagging exports . The CCP has shown that it's willing to take dramatic action to stabilize the economy. The price of that action, though, is massive debt built up all over the financial system, held especially by property companies, state-owned enterprises, and local governments. In the past, monetary easing calmed gyrations in the financial system, but growth has never been this slow, and debt has never been this high. The problem does not match the price tag here. The Chinese Communist Party has a bubble on its hands, and it doesn't want to blow much more or see it burst in spectacular fashion. Plus, there's Xi, who seems fairly uninterested in restructuring the property market. He wants government investment to focus on developing frontier technology and boosting exports to grow the economy out of its structural debt problems. But those new streams of income have yet to materialize for China, and establishing them will take time and working through trade conflict, principally with the US and the European Union. Consider the easing measures we're seeing as something like a moment for markets to catch their breath — a respite from what has been a constant stream of bad economic news. But a respite is all it is. Linette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Business Insider.

Chevron Corporation (CVX): Warren Buffett’s Stock Recommended by Analysts Read full article Neha Gupta Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 11:09 PM 6 min read Link Copied 4 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy. 2024 will go down in history as the year that legendary investor Warren Buffett started showing signs of slowing down after an illustrious career in the investment world. After losing his best friend and longtime partner, Charlie Munger, the Oracle of Omaha increasingly shows signs of relinquishing control of his investment empire. Even with his investment company becoming the first non-tech giant to hit the $1 trillion mark on market cap, Buffett is slowly relinquishing control after years of tremendous success. Handpicked Greg Abel is now responsible for taking over the Buffett Empire after more than 60 years in the limelight. READ ALSO: Carl Icahn Stock Portfolio: 7 Best Stocks to Buy and 10 Best Performing Warren Buffett Stocks in 2024 . As Abel assumes control in making key investment decisions, Buffett continues sending shockwaves. Nevertheless, he has become a net seller, having trimmed stakes in some high-profile holdings, all but raising concerns about the market outlook. At 94, Buffett has seen it all, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the years and generated significant returns for his investors. Since 1965, the billionaire investor has averaged returns of 19.8% through his investment firm, nearly double the 10.2% return of the S&P 500 over the same period. Nevertheless, he appears to have hit the peak of his investment career as he became a net seller after one of the longest bull runs. The recent sales have taken Buffett’s cash haul to the $300 billion mark, which he can use to purchase a good chunk of the S&P 500 companies. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has shown reluctance to invest in the cash-sitting valuations that have gotten out of hand. Since Buffett has yet to carry out a massive investment this year, it does not come as a surprise. The advocate of value investing, which involves analyzing the market for undervalued stocks likely to generate long-term value, has been skeptical about valuations. His reluctance also comes on outperformance in recent years, becoming extremely difficult due to the sheer size of Buffett’s investment portfolio. “We have no possibility of eye-popping performance” given that “there remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,” Buffett is quoted as saying in an interview with CNBC. Story continues With the S&P 500 up by more than 20% for the year, Buffett has indicated that the market might be too expensive to pursue opportunities at current levels. Consequently, he has opted to stay in cash while locking in profits through buybacks and dividends in some of his top investment plays. Nevertheless, the market is still full of some of the best Warren Buffett stocks that analysts see material upside to. In the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rateby 50 basis points and indicating the prospects of further cuts before year-end, opportunities are increasingly emerging around some of Buffett’s top investment plays Even as Buffett waits for the market to correct to deploy the more than $300 billion at his disposal, there are still opportunities to pursue as interest rates trend down. With that, let’s look at the 8 best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology To compile the list of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts, we sifted through Berkshire Hathaway’s Q2 2024 13F portfolio. We scanned all the 13F holdings and picked the 8 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of September 24. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ) Warren Buffett’s Q2 2024 Stake: $18.55 Billion Analyst Upside Potential, as of September 26: 23% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of Buffett’s investment plays for exposure in the energy sector. While the company has felt the full brunt of oil prices plunging from above the $80 barrel level, it remains one of the companies well poised to navigate the challenging environment. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) operates as an integrated energy firm throughout the industry, meaning it is involved in all aspects of the energy sector. This includes involvement in oil and natural gas exploration and production (upstream), the transportation of energy (midstream), and the processing of chemicals and refining (downstream). At any given moment, each of these areas of the industry can show varying levels of performance. The company’s competitive edge stems from having a balance sheet capable of weathering down any energy industry cycle while continuing to reward investors with dividends. Additionally, the company boasts of one of the lowest debt-to-equity ratios of 0.15 as it pays more attention to its balance sheet. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) can increase its financial strength when the oil price falls, enabling the company to keep investing in its operations and distributing dividends. It’s worth noting that the dividend has risen for an impressive 37 years straight, marking an extraordinary achievement considering Chevron’s competitive industry. As oil prices rise again, as they invariably do, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) decreases its financial exposure to prepare for the next economic slump. For conservative investors seeking a reliable energy stock that can weather any storm, finding a more attractive alternative than Chevron’s 4.5% dividend yield would be challenging. The stock commands an average buy rating on Wall Street with a $177.08 price target, implying 23% upside potential. In the second quarter of 2024, 64 hedge funds held positions in the stock, with total stakes reaching $22.41 billion. By June 30, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest shareholder, holding a position valued at $18.55 billion. In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter , Diamond Hill Capital’s Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy commented on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX): “Other bottom contributors included Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Carrier Global and Becton, Dickinson. Shares of integrated oil and gas company Chevron were pressured as global oil production is growing — particularly in the US, which has now surpassed its past production levels — in turn pressuring oil prices and company profit margins.” Overall CVX ranks 3rd on our list of 8 Best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

If our list is anything to go by, you have to be an intensely hardworking, intellectually curious team player who's willing to go the distance to drive the biggest deals, win the most sought-after clients, or build the most successful businesses. Every year , Business Insider taps its contacts to put together a list of who to watch on Wall Street. For the past seven years, we've received recommendations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and financial industry experts to create our annual feature. We ask that nominees be based in the US, be 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers to be eligible. The editors make the final decisions. These young professionals reflect the future of finance. A number of them are shaping the future of clean energy and artificial intelligence by financing the infrastructure that will underpin it. Some have seen their focus go from niche to hot asset. Others are influencing how Wall Street interacts with Main Street, using their skills and savvy to create new products and services for ordinary investors or giving employees at portfolio companies ownership stakes . Advertisement Business Insider asked these rising stars from leading firms like JPMorgan, Bridgewater, and Apollo to reflect on their successes, challenges, and best career advice. Advertisement Alissa Song, 31, KKR KKR One of the most memorable days of Song's KKR career was when the firm sold Minnesota Rubber and Plastics for $950 million in August 2022. She had served on the business' board while getting her MBA and led the monthslong sales process. The best part, however, was traveling to the firm's Plymouth, Minnesota, manufacturing plant to tell employees they'd be receiving a payout as equity holders in the company. Since trialing its employee-ownership program in 2015, KKR has awarded billions of dollars of equity to over 100,000 nonsenior management employees across more than 50 portfolio companies. The firm bet that giving portfolio company workers a piece of the private-equity pie would actually grow the size of the pie. Since graduating from Harvard in 2015, Song has worked on KKR's industrials portfolio team, which has been a proving ground for the employee-ownership program. She worked for four years on the firm's CHI Overhead Doors deal, which has become the case study for its employee-engagement model. All five deals she's worked on at KKR have an employee-ownership component. Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley after her family emigrated from China when she was 3, has long been a community builder. She rose through the ranks of Future Business Leaders of America in middle and high school to become the California state president before serving as copresident of Harvard's Undergraduate Women in Business program. Song, now a principal at the firm, said the feeling of community on the industrials team is one of the reasons she's stayed at KKR for nearly a decade. She said her friends and family were surprised she ended up investing in industrials, but she's become fascinated by the sector. "Everything that you can learn about in a business textbook, this role takes it to the real world, and I can see it in action here," Song said. Advertisement Annie Cheslin, 34, Wells Fargo Wells Fargo While researching investment-banking internships in college at Emory, Cheslin contacted a family friend who invited her to visit his trading floor and experience Wall Street for herself. It was love at first sight. "I walked onto the trading floor and never looked back," Cheslin told BI. "As soon as I walked onto the floor, heard the energy, heard the noise, I was like, 'This is somewhere that I want to be.' Maybe that sounds cliché." Today, Cheslin is a managing director in high-grade municipal trading at Wells Fargo. She joined the bank in 2012 as an analyst based in the firm's Charlotte, North Carolina, office, but later transferred to New York. She became a managing director in February. Cheslin, who's part of a team that manages billions, works with institutional clients to address their liquidity needs. She recalled an inflection point in her career in early 2022 when she was on maternity leave and the market was hit by volatility stemming from the Fed's interest-rate hikes . She recalled returning to work in what she characterized as a "completely different market landscape." But the team pulled through and logged a record year. "Knowing that I was a visible part of the effort to grow Wells Fargo's market share and to be growing our municipal franchise to be one of the top sales and trading desks on the Street is something that I'm incredibly proud of," she added. She said one key quality that's helped fuel her rise is staying open to whatever work opportunity has come her way. "Being visible not only on your desk as someone who is willing to do any task — I think that's the mindset that I've tried to keep from analyst to managing director is that I'm never bigger than any task that I would do myself." Advertisement Austin Anton, 32, Apollo Global Management Apollo Anton got an early start in finance, buying stocks in high school during the 2008 financial crisis. Some bets, like buying Bank of America stock at its trough, paid off. (He chalks up less-successful bets, such as one on Bear Stearns, to experience.) This introduction came in handy for his first job after college as a financial institutions group analyst at Credit Suisse's investment bank. He spent two years there and another two at Kohlberg and Company before joining Apollo in 2018. The 32-year-old principal's work runs the gamut from insurance to agriculture. He helped raise capital for Apollo's retirement services unit, Athene, by developing a fundraising strategy that allows third parties to invest alongside the firm. These funding vehicles, or "sidecars," have raised $9.3 billion in committed capital as of June 30. Anton was also Apollo's day-to-day lead on Vallourec, the French steel giant. Apollo sold its 28% stake for 955 million euros, about $1.04 billion, in March. Anton helped lead the acquisition of Vallourec during the COVID-19 pandemic and the firm's restructuring, which included moving operations from Germany to Brazil. He anticipates more opportunistic metals deals on the horizon as prices decline. Anton, who majored in history at Princeton, credits his versatility to his fondness for learning about different sectors and the successes and failures in each field. "A lot of stuff has been done before," he said. "If you have the curiosity and build up your knowledge of the past, I've found that to be really beneficial as you think about covering new sectors or moving to a new job." As Apollo courts wealthy individuals, Anton is developing new investment products that allow the firm to partially cash out quarterly or monthly in exchange for somewhat lower returns. Apollo sells about $1 billion a month in semiliquid products spanning private credit and real assets. "It's going to be a really big growth area for the firm," he said. Advertisement Ben Carper, 34, Jefferies Jefferies Carper has spent his career carving out a specialty in a niche area of finance: continuation vehicles, also known as "secondaries." He helps private-equity firms raise new funds to purchase companies they already own — giving existing investors a return while keeping the company's current management team and extending the life cycle of the asset for the PE firm. "Effectively, what we do is we help private-equity firms sell their highest-conviction, favorite portfolio companies to themselves," Carper said. He spent the first five years of his career as an investor on the buy side, including stints at Morgan Stanley and Coller Capital, before joining Lazard's private capital advisory business in 2018 and Jefferies in 2021. Earlier this year, Carper helped Vestar Capital Partners close a $1.2 billion continuation vehicle for its stake in the research company Circana. He also helped Calera Capital close a $750 million continuation vehicle for the linen and laundry service company ImageFIRST. Over Carper's career, these structures have switched from being a solution to a liquidity problem to a strategy that allows PE firms to hold on to some of their best portfolio companies and raise new capital, he said. When he entered the industry, he estimated there was less than $10 billion in continuation-vehicle volume annually. Now, there's more than $60 billion, and he thinks that will only grow. "I'm really excited to say that I think as a portion of the overall ecosystem, it's quite likely to grow," he said. "There's a lot of capital that is being formed to attack the opportunity right now." Advertisement Blake Cecil, 32, Bridgewater Associates Bridgewater Associates Cecil, one of two deputy chief investment officers at $108 billion Bridgewater Associates, was so ready to work full time at the firm that he dropped out of Columbia University to jump-start his career. "The thing I really liked was the intensity, the competitive nature of markets, the authenticity of Bridgewater's culture," Cecil, who first interned at the firm before joining full time in 2017, said. In his current role, he works closely with co-CIO Greg Jensen to gather insights and research from different teams and turn them into trades for the flagship strategy, Pure Alpha, which was up more than 14% through the first half of the year. "The oversight is about innovation — what's the big thing we might be missing?" Cecil said. Reams of deep research don't go far if there's not "a trader's mentality" to actually extract "a piece of alpha" from them, he said. He said he's constantly thinking about how to make sure the portfolio is "the expression of the things we believe about the world." He was promoted to his current role at the start of this year after making his name at the firm with his research on currencies. That background has pushed him to search beyond stock and bond markets for alpha — and to consider how different assets will work in a single portfolio. "There's a lot more room for us to think about how all these asset classes come together," he said. Advertisement Chi Chen, 34, BlackRock BlackRock Being named a portfolio manager of BlackRock's Total Return Fund in 2022, alongside the managers Rick Rieder and David Rogal, was a defining moment for Chen. "Becoming a named PM — it is incredible," Chen told BI. "I see that as a result of the ongoing contribution that I have had toward this set of funds and to the group." Chen calls herself a BlackRock lifer. She's been at the company 13 years and started out as an intern in the same fixed-income investment division she's currently in — only now she's comanaging a total of $60 billion across BlackRock's core, core plus, and global government portfolio mandates and leading research efforts for US rates. The Total Return Fund has about $20 billion in assets. Chen grew up in China and moved to the US by herself at 17 to attend high school in Ohio. She studied economics and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and joined BlackRock full time in 2012 as an analyst focusing on US interest rates. She also had a stint as a macro researcher on the economics team. BlackRock's managing director credits her rise to the quality of her research. He said she was always willing to dig deep into the data to uncover differentiated views, which the group's leaders noticed. "The intention or the motivation for me really was wanting to turn my ideas into action and see how they play out in the market," Chen said. Her parents, who spent their entire careers in China's postal service, began working in their teens and studied part time to earn college degrees. They instilled a strong work ethic and passion for learning. "They basically immersed in me to just spend time at the library," she said. "I think my mindset of always trying to explore and trying to see more of the world came from a very young age because of that." Advertisement Corey White, 35, Bank of America Bank of America White started his career working in franchising for Burger King, where his job was to bring on larger, better-capitalized franchisees, which usually turned out to be a PE firm or a family office. "The stories from the families and the entrepreneurs and the funds and their thesis were super interesting to me," he said. "So I decided to go to school and scale that up." After completing his MBA at Northwestern in 2017, White joined Bank of America's consumer and retail investment banking team in New York. He's since played a key role in introducing a new focus for Bank of America as part of its emerging growth and regional coverage team. "A lot of our strategy was to take all the resources and all the talent that we were putting against bulge-bracket opportunities and bring it to the middle market and try and find opportunities that normally Bank America would not have been as tuned in to," White said. He took "a leap of faith" and joined the team in Chicago in 2019. "It was kind of full circle, having started my career with entrepreneurs," said White, who now advises family-owned businesses, founders, and early investors in those companies to deepen the bank's relationships in private capital markets and attach that to its public capital markets business. Even in a time of muted IPOs, White led a large industrial IPO this year. In 2023, he was key in advising a large financial sponsor client in a take-private transaction in healthcare. He also helped lead a buy-side transaction for a family-owned consumer business, where Bank of America was both the advisor and financing partner to the client. He has advised on more than 30 transactions totaling over $25 billion. Since White joined the Chicago team, he has helped it grow from three to 25 people. His advice to young professionals in the industry is to "be your own feedback loop." "Don't wait for someone to tell you something did or didn't go well. Assess every situation yourself, almost obsessively think about, 'How can I have done that better?'" Advertisement Craig Kolwicz, 35,

Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 hit fresh records to cap strong September, quarter Read full article Josh Schafer and Karen Friar Updated Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 11:15 PM Link Copied 336 In this article: US stocks bid farewell to the month and the quarter with fresh records as investors reacted to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell vowing to do what it takes to keep the economy humming, while signaling he won't rush future rate cuts. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose 0.4% to close at a new record, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained close to 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) finished just above the flatline, securing its latest all-time-high. Typically the cruelest month for stocks, Wall Street indexes recorded monthly wins to close out the last trading day of September. Notably, the S&P 500 notched its best year-to-date performance at September's end since 1997. The S&P also enjoyed its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021. Over the last three months, the Dow led the major indexes' gains, up 8.2%. The S&P gained 5.4%, and the Nasdaq added nearly 3%. The Federal Reserve's jumbo interest rate cut and signs of resilience in the US economy have lifted confidence, helping stocks post three weekly wins in a row. The final trading day of the month and the quarter also came with profit taking and rebalancing. Investors are now bracing for the September jobs report, due out on Friday, which is seen as posing an important test for the recent rally . The pressing question is just how quickly the labor market is slowing as the market weighs whether the Fed has acted aggressively to protect a healthy economy or to help a flailing one. "Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said in a speech before the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. His remarks come days ahead of the the crucial monthly jobs report. Powell's comments on not rushing the next round of rate decisions also lowered expectations of another jumbo cut.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose 0.4% to close at a new record, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained close to 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) finished just above the flatline, securing its latest all-time-high. Over the last three months the Dow finished up 8.2%, leading the pack. The S&P gained 5.4% and the Nasdaq added nearly 3%. Looking ahead to the rest of the week, investors are bracing for the September jobs report, due out on Friday, which is seen as posing an important test for the recent rally . The pressing question is just how quickly the labor market is slowing as the market weighs the Federal Reserve's next step after cutting rates by 50 basis points. During a speech on Monday Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed isn't in a rush to cut rates, but that officials will do what it takes to keep the economy on solid ground. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 8:46 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban A historically tough month set to ends with gains Typically a challenging month for stocks, September has turned out to be a positive one for the major gauges, rounding out a solid quarter and setting the stage for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) was on track to increase 1.4% for the month and ended the quarter up 7.8%, leading the pack. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was set to gain about 1.5% for September and just under 5% for the quarter. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) was poised to add 2% for the month and close to 2% for the quarter. The start of October could further boost the bullish mood if the next batch of economic data shows more favorable signs. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports , some analysts see the next step of the cycle as ushering in a bundle of positive factors. Any evidence that the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates amid an ideal backdrop of continuous economic growth , a solid labor market, and easing inflation would be a "hugely bullish" outcome for equities, Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser said. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 7:51 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Powell speech lowers expectations for another jumbo rate cut On Monday afternoon Fed Chair Jerome Powell vowed to do what it takes to keep the economy humming. But his remarks clarifying that the central bank is not on a predetermined path, and isn't in a rush to quickly cut rates also appeared to lower expectations for another 50 basis point cut. Market bets for another half-percent cut dropped to 35% Monday afternoon, compared to 53% a day ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said in a speech before the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. His remarks come days ahead of the the crucial monthly jobs report. Powell said if the economy unfolds as expected, the Fed will cut interest rates "over time toward a more neutral stance." But it is in no rush, he made clear during a question-and-answer session following his speech. “This is not a committee that wants to cut rates quickly,” added Powell, referring to the Fed body that decides on the direction of rates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 7:00 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Chevron stock rises as FTC allows Hess deal Shares of Chevron rose close to 0.6% Monday afternoon following news that the US Federal Trade Commission cleared the company's $53 billion purchase of Hess Corp but barred CEO John Hess from serving on Chevron's board. Even after the FTC's order, a final obstacle to the deal is still present in Exxon Mobile's challenge to the deal, Reuters reported . The FTC alleged that Hess had openly communicated with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stabilize global oil markets. The FTC also said that allowing him to serve on Chevron's board "would amplify Mr. Hess's supportive messaging to OPEC and others, thereby meaningfully increasing the likelihood that Chevron would align its production with OPEC's output decisions to maintain higher prices." The deal by the No. 2 US oil company will give Chevron access to the oil-rich offshore fields of Guyana. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 6:33 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Stocks trending in afternoon trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Monday: Stellantis ( STLA ): Shares of the automaker tumbled 14% Monday afternoon after the company issued a stark warning about its North American operations , dragging other auto stocks lower. Carnival ( CCL ): The cruise line fell 3% Monday after the company beat analyst expectations for the third quarter and raised its full-year guidance. But the results were still not enough to please investors looking for even stronger results. Meta ( META ): The social media company is still riding the optimism sparked by its developer conference last week, where it featured AI and mixed reality updates. Shares rose nearly 1% Monday following an analyst upgrade as Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co. upped its price target from $570 to $620 on the strength of Meta's showcase and future services. Boeing ( BA ): The airplane manufacturer sank deeper into its slump as the factory worker strike heads into its third week without a solution in sight and as talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike. Shares fell more than 2% Monday. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 5:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Real estate leads S&P 500 higher The Real Estate ( XLRE ) sector rose more than 0.5% to lead the S&P 500 on Monday in a day with relatively subdued market action. The benchmark index itself was up just 0.06% around 12:30 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the Materials ( XLB ) sector was the biggest laggard falling 0.8%. Source: Yahoo Finance Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:45 PM GMT+1 Laura Bratton Nvidia stock slips on China sales fears Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock slipped around 1% in early trading after falling as much as 2.8% before the market open. The drop follows a report from Bloomberg Friday that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders — rather than Nvidia’s popular GPUs. Nvidia has designed special chips for China since the US ramped up export controls on semiconductors to the country beginning in late 2022. Nvidia currently exports a version of its Hopper chip called H20, which complies with tougher trade rules, to China. Nvidia is reportedly working to bring online a version of its latest Blackwell chips for China as well. Analysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Investors look for signs of growth in key economic data week A slew of labor market data headlined by the September jobs report will be in focus for investors this week. Updates on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors will also catch attention as market participants attempt to discern how quickly the US economy is slowing. Wall Street strategists argue there’s a clear read through on what type of data would be supportive of a further rally in stocks. Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance a scenario where the Fed isn't cutting because the economy needs it is "hugely bullish" for equities. Therefore a stronger than expected jobs report would likely be seen as a positive for stocks. The September jobs report is expected to show 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In August, the US economy added 142,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2%. "Everything is about the growth side of the economy and everything is about the consumer," Kaiser said. "Any data that suggests consumer spending is holding in and you're not seeing the weakness that people are worried about and that the Fed is worried about, I think that's all going to be positive for equity markets." Subsequently, a bad jobs report on Friday could have the opposite impact on stocks. "If it turns out that they started cutting because they're legitimately concerned about weakness in the labor market, rate cuts aren't going to be enough to help equities in that case and you're going to trade lower," Kaiser said. "So the why [the Fed is cutting] matters here. And payrolls is going to help answer that." Mon, September 30, 2024 at 3:15 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Automakers slide as Stellantis cuts 2024 profit outlook Stellantis ( STLA ) stock sank nearly 13% as the automaker cut its 2024 profit forecast. Instead of positive cash flow for the year, Stellantis now expects negative cash flow in a range of $5.58 billion to $11.17 billion. The automaker said it also expects its adjusted operating profit margin to come in between 5.5% and 7% this year, lower than the double-digit margins Stellantis initially forecast. “Deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period, while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply, as well as increased Chinese competition,” Stellantis said in a release. Ford ( F ) and GM ( GM ) also traded lower after the news. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 2:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Stocks slide at the open, all eyes on Powell US stocks moved lower on Monday but were still set for strong monthly and quarterly gains as investors waited to hear Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak in the run-up to the crucial monthly jobs report. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) all fell about 0.2%. With few catalysts to kick off the week, Powell’s speech on Monday afternoon is expected to be key. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 1:50 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer DirecTV to buy Dish Network Another media acquisition has been confirmed. Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal reports: Satellite TV provider DirecTV ( T , TPG ) said Monday it will buy rival Dish Network ( SATS ), including Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, through a debt exchange transaction. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is set to create one of the US's largest pay-TV providers. "The combination of DirecTV and Dish will benefit US video consumers by creating a more robust competitive force in a video industry dominated by streaming services owned by large tech companies and programmers," the companies said in a joint statement. Shares in EchoStar ( SATS ), which owns Dish Network, moved about 1% higher in premarket trading following the news. The stock had surged nearly 10% on Friday after the acquisition rumors intensified.

Typically the cruelest month for stocks, Wall Street indexes recorded monthly wins to close out the last trading day of September. Notably, the S&P 500 notched its best year-to-date performance at September's end since 1997. The S&P also enjoyed its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021. Over the last three months, the Dow led the major indexes' gains, up 8.2%. The S&P gained 5.4%, and the Nasdaq added nearly 3%. The Federal Reserve's jumbo interest rate cut and signs of resilience in the US economy have lifted confidence, helping stocks post three weekly wins in a row. The final trading day of the month and the quarter also came with profit taking and rebalancing. Investors are now bracing for the September jobs report, due out on Friday, which is seen as posing an important test for the recent rally . The pressing question is just how quickly the labor market is slowing as the market weighs whether the Fed has acted aggressively to protect a healthy economy or to help a flailing one. "Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said in a speech before the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. His remarks come days ahead of the the crucial monthly jobs report. Powell's comments on not rushing the next round of rate decisions also lowered expectations of another jumbo cut.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose 0.4% to close at a new record, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained close to 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) finished just above the flatline, securing its latest all-time-high. Over the last three months the Dow finished up 8.2%, leading the pack. The S&P gained 5.4% and the Nasdaq added nearly 3%. Looking ahead to the rest of the week, investors are bracing for the September jobs report, due out on Friday, which is seen as posing an important test for the recent rally . The pressing question is just how quickly the labor market is slowing as the market weighs the Federal Reserve's next step after cutting rates by 50 basis points. During a speech on Monday Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed isn't in a rush to cut rates, but that officials will do what it takes to keep the economy on solid ground. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 8:46 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban A historically tough month set to ends with gains Typically a challenging month for stocks, September has turned out to be a positive one for the major gauges, rounding out a solid quarter and setting the stage for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) was on track to increase 1.4% for the month and ended the quarter up 7.8%, leading the pack. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was set to gain about 1.5% for September and just under 5% for the quarter. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) was poised to add 2% for the month and close to 2% for the quarter. The start of October could further boost the bullish mood if the next batch of economic data shows more favorable signs. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports , some analysts see the next step of the cycle as ushering in a bundle of positive factors. Any evidence that the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates amid an ideal backdrop of continuous economic growth , a solid labor market, and easing inflation would be a "hugely bullish" outcome for equities, Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser said. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 7:51 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Powell speech lowers expectations for another jumbo rate cut On Monday afternoon Fed Chair Jerome Powell vowed to do what it takes to keep the economy humming. But his remarks clarifying that the central bank is not on a predetermined path, and isn't in a rush to quickly cut rates also appeared to lower expectations for another 50 basis point cut. Market bets for another half-percent cut dropped to 35% Monday afternoon, compared to 53% a day ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said in a speech before the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. His remarks come days ahead of the the crucial monthly jobs report. Powell said if the economy unfolds as expected, the Fed will cut interest rates "over time toward a more neutral stance." But it is in no rush, he made clear during a question-and-answer session following his speech. “This is not a committee that wants to cut rates quickly,” added Powell, referring to the Fed body that decides on the direction of rates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 7:00 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Chevron stock rises as FTC allows Hess deal Shares of Chevron rose close to 0.6% Monday afternoon following news that the US Federal Trade Commission cleared the company's $53 billion purchase of Hess Corp but barred CEO John Hess from serving on Chevron's board. Even after the FTC's order, a final obstacle to the deal is still present in Exxon Mobile's challenge to the deal, Reuters reported . The FTC alleged that Hess had openly communicated with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stabilize global oil markets. The FTC also said that allowing him to serve on Chevron's board "would amplify Mr. Hess's supportive messaging to OPEC and others, thereby meaningfully increasing the likelihood that Chevron would align its production with OPEC's output decisions to maintain higher prices." The deal by the No. 2 US oil company will give Chevron access to the oil-rich offshore fields of Guyana. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 6:33 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Stocks trending in afternoon trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Monday: Stellantis ( STLA ): Shares of the automaker tumbled 14% Monday afternoon after the company issued a stark warning about its North American operations , dragging other auto stocks lower. Carnival ( CCL ): The cruise line fell 3% Monday after the company beat analyst expectations for the third quarter and raised its full-year guidance. But the results were still not enough to please investors looking for even stronger results. Meta ( META ): The social media company is still riding the optimism sparked by its developer conference last week, where it featured AI and mixed reality updates. Shares rose nearly 1% Monday following an analyst upgrade as Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co. upped its price target from $570 to $620 on the strength of Meta's showcase and future services. Boeing ( BA ): The airplane manufacturer sank deeper into its slump as the factory worker strike heads into its third week without a solution in sight and as talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike. Shares fell more than 2% Monday. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 5:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Real estate leads S&P 500 higher The Real Estate ( XLRE ) sector rose more than 0.5% to lead the S&P 500 on Monday in a day with relatively subdued market action. The benchmark index itself was up just 0.06% around 12:30 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the Materials ( XLB ) sector was the biggest laggard falling 0.8%. Source: Yahoo Finance Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:45 PM GMT+1 Laura Bratton Nvidia stock slips on China sales fears Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock slipped around 1% in early trading after falling as much as 2.8% before the market open. The drop follows a report from Bloomberg Friday that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders — rather than Nvidia’s popular GPUs. Nvidia has designed special chips for China since the US ramped up export controls on semiconductors to the country beginning in late 2022. Nvidia currently exports a version of its Hopper chip called H20, which complies with tougher trade rules, to China. Nvidia is reportedly working to bring online a version of its latest Blackwell chips for China as well. Analysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Investors look for signs of growth in key economic data week A slew of labor market data headlined by the September jobs report will be in focus for investors this week. Updates on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors will also catch attention as market participants attempt to discern how quickly the US economy is slowing. Wall Street strategists argue there’s a clear read through on what type of data would be supportive of a further rally in stocks. Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance a scenario where the Fed isn't cutting because the economy needs it is "hugely bullish" for equities. Therefore a stronger than expected jobs report would likely be seen as a positive for stocks. The September jobs report is expected to show 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In August, the US economy added 142,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2%. "Everything is about the growth side of the economy and everything is about the consumer," Kaiser said. "Any data that suggests consumer spending is holding in and you're not seeing the weakness that people are worried about and that the Fed is worried about, I think that's all going to be positive for equity markets." Subsequently, a bad jobs report on Friday could have the opposite impact on stocks. "If it turns out that they started cutting because they're legitimately concerned about weakness in the labor market, rate cuts aren't going to be enough to help equities in that case and you're going to trade lower," Kaiser said. "So the why [the Fed is cutting] matters here. And payrolls is going to help answer that." Mon, September 30, 2024 at 3:15 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Automakers slide as Stellantis cuts 2024 profit outlook Stellantis ( STLA ) stock sank nearly 13% as the automaker cut its 2024 profit forecast. Instead of positive cash flow for the year, Stellantis now expects negative cash flow in a range of $5.58 billion to $11.17 billion. The automaker said it also expects its adjusted operating profit margin to come in between 5.5% and 7% this year, lower than the double-digit margins Stellantis initially forecast. “Deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period, while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply, as well as increased Chinese competition,” Stellantis said in a release. Ford ( F ) and GM ( GM ) also traded lower after the news. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 2:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Stocks slide at the open, all eyes on Powell US stocks moved lower on Monday but were still set for strong monthly and quarterly gains as investors waited to hear Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak in the run-up to the crucial monthly jobs report. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) all fell about 0.2%. With few catalysts to kick off the week, Powell’s speech on Monday afternoon is expected to be key. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 1:50 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer DirecTV to buy Dish Network Another media acquisition has been confirmed. Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal reports: Satellite TV provider DirecTV ( T , TPG ) said Monday it will buy rival Dish Network ( SATS ), including Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, through a debt exchange transaction. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is set to create one of the US's largest pay-TV providers. "The combination of DirecTV and Dish will benefit US video consumers by creating a more robust competitive force in a video industry dominated by streaming services owned by large tech companies and programmers," the companies said in a joint statement. Shares in EchoStar ( SATS ), which owns Dish Network, moved about 1% higher in premarket trading following the news. The stock had surged nearly 10% on Friday after the acquisition rumors intensified.

Are Investors Undervaluing Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) By 42%? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 5:09 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Performance Food Group fair value estimate is US$135 Performance Food Group's US$78.21 share price signals that it might be 42% undervalued The US$87.40 analyst price target for PFGC is 35% less than our estimate of fair value Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Performance Food Group Company ( NYSE:PFGC ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Performance Food Group The Model We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$834.6m US$934.3m US$897.0m US$880.2m US$875.2m US$878.3m US$887.1m US$899.9m US$915.8m US$934.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ -1.88% Est @ -0.56% Est @ 0.36% Est @ 1.00% Est @ 1.45% Est @ 1.76% Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$786 US$830 US$750 US$694 US$650 US$615 US$585 US$559 US$536 US$515 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%. Story continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$934m× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.5%) = US$26b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$26b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%) 10 = US$15b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$21b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$78.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf Important Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Performance Food Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.880. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Performance Food Group Strength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Consumer Retailing industry. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Next Steps: Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Performance Food Group, there are three fundamental factors you should explore: Risks : Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Edit Story Premium Daily Cover Why The Commanders’ Owner Thinks $6 Billion For An NFL Team Is A Bargain Private equity titan Joshua Harris of 26North, is the NFL's newest owner. cody pickens for forbes Hank Tucker Forbes Staff Hank Tucker is a Forbes staff writer covering finance and investing. Maneet Ahuja Forbes Staff Editor-at-Large at Forbes covering billionaires and beyond Sep 30, 2024, 06:30am EDT Updated Oct 1, 2024, 07:43am EDT On Wall Street, risk-free investments are the Holy Grail, so no price is too high to pay for an NFL team. Now a new wave of private equity owners are entering the game with mountains of cash–and nothing to lose. By Maneet Ahuja and Hank Tucker , Forbes Staff A s 63,000 diehard fans pour into Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, for the Buccaneers’ season opener against the Washington Commanders, billionaire Josh Harris, Washington’s new controlling owner, is feeling the heat. It is 90 degrees on this early September afternoon, and sweat is seeping through his maroon polo. He paces the field peri­meter with security in tow, beaming as he shakes hands, poses for pictures and signs hats for Commanders supporters praying for a winning season (the team’s last one was in 2016). Harris hears an eager fan shouting his name. His T-shirt reads: “We almost always almost win.” A humorously defeatist attitude befitting the last 30 years of Washington football. “They went through a lot, and they’ve been there a long time waiting for this,” says the 59-year-old Harris. “Having grown up [near D.C.], it’s very personal for me. Obviously, you have to deliver, right? I stay up at night thinking about that.” As the Harris era begins, there’s a lot at stake. The $6 billion he paid for the Commanders last year—besting interest from the likes of Jeff Bezos and Tilman Fertitta—en­ded Daniel Snyder’s scandal-plagued tenure and set a record for the sale of an NFL team. To get the deal done, Harris assembled a 23-person ownership group that included David Blitzer—a top exec at Blackstone and Harris’ partner in his other sports endeavors through Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment—as well as NBA legend Magic Johnson and billionaires Mitch Rales (Danaher Corp.) and Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO. Harris didn’t make any rash changes after the deal closed in July 2023, but after a disappointing 4-13 season, he cleaned house, bringing in a new head coach, general manager and quarterback, Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels, the second pick in this spring’s draft. Cody Pickens for Forbes For a kid who grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, whose parents spent 25 years on the waiting list for season tickets to see the then-Washington Redskins play at historic RFK Stadium, it’s a dream come true. It also fits nicely into the private equity titan’s sports portfolio, which includes the Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, English soccer club Crystal Palace and Nascar team Joe Gibbs Racing. Soon Harris is likely to be joined in the exclusive NFL owners’ club by more of his buyout-fund brethren. Last month the NFL became the last major professional league to open its doors to private equity firms, with owners voting 31-1—Cincinnati’s Brown family was the only dissent—to allow a select group of approved firms to buy up to 10% of each team, subject to several other restrictions, such as a minimum holding period of six years. It’s a watershed moment for a league that has seen team values skyrocket into the multibillion-dollar range, severely limiting the pool of potential buyers. Even Harris, worth an estimated $9.3 billion, worried that owning a professional football team would soon be out of reach. When hedge fund heavyweight David Tepper bought the Carolina Panthers in 2018 for $2.3 billion, it was the most anyone had ever paid for an NFL franchise. No other team came up for sale until 2022, when Pat Bowlen’s heirs put the Denver Broncos on the market. Harris put together a group to make an offer, but a group led by the Walton family outbid him to pay a staggering $4.7 billion, doubling Tepper’s record. “The way the NFL was heading, forget about The Forbes 400,” Harris says. “You had to be in The Forbes 50.” Inviting Wall Street to the NFL party is a game changer. The eight private equity funds approved by the NFL to invest, including Blackstone, Carlyle, Arctos and Ares Management, currently have dry powder in excess of $160 billion. That’s a lot of firepower. It will ensure that franchise values, which by Forbes’ reckoning have appreciated more than 60% in the last three years, continue to rise. In fact, barely two weeks after the ink was dry on the NFL’s ownership rule change, Arctos was in talks with Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins, to buy a stake in his team that would value it north of $7 billion. For private equity firms like Arctos, it’s a no-brainer. NFL teams are underleveraged, yet they rake in so much from media rights deals it’s almost impossible not to turn a profit whether they win or lose. Since 2000, NFL teams have significantly outperformed nearly every other asset, including stocks, real estate, bonds—and, yes, private equity funds . If you adjust for risk, the numbers look even better. “In business you’re graded by Ebitda and stock price and cash flow,” Harris says. “In sports you’re graded by creating positive memories.” J oshua Harris, the eldest son of an orthodontist who was a collegiate rower at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1950s, is a lifelong sports devotee. Growing up in Maryland, he played Little League, basketball and soccer. When he was 9, he found his true love, wrestling, after winning a tournament at summer camp. He would go on to compete competitively all the way through high school at the Field School in D.C. and in college at Penn, representing the Quakers at 118 pounds. After excelling in economics his freshman year, he transferred to the Wharton School and, like many of the college’s Reagan-era graduates, made his way to Wall Street. He landed at Drexel Burnham Lambert during the peak of Michael Milken’s junk bond-fueled profitability. He worked for two years in mergers at the firm’s New York office under the tutelage of Milken’s right-hand man, Leon Black. During Harris’ short stint at Drexel, the firm was making headlines for its involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, and Milken’s operation came under investigation by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney’s office. Harris left in 1988 to pursue an MBA from Harvard and in 1990 accepted a job at Blackstone. Just two months later, however, he quit to join Leon Black and Marc Rowan, both refugees from Drexel’s collapse, to start Apollo Advisors. The trio spent the next 30 years building Apollo into one of the world’s largest private equity firms, now managing $700 billion in assets. Harris was known to be demanding and obsessive about details. His most notable deal was acquiring Dutch chemical maker LyondellBasell in 2008, using $2 billion of its distressed bank debt. After managing it through a prolonged bankruptcy and a 2010 IPO, Harris and partners wound up netting a $10 billion profit by the time they fully cashed out in 2013. Black became tainted by his close ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, whom he paid $158 million for tax and estate planning services, and when Black stepped down under pressure in 2021, Apollo’s board picked Rowan, not Harris, to succeed him as CEO. While Josh Harris can thank private equity for his initial billions, sports are making him richer faster. cody Pickens for forbes Harris quit later that year but didn’t stay away from private equity for long. He launched 26North in 2022 and has already built it to $23 billion in assets, announcing its first buyout—of ArchKey, a Missouri-based electrical contractor for commercial buildings—in September for more than $1 billion. “The ability to generate alpha was harder with over half a trillion or a trillion dollars, so I wanted to go back to basics,” he says. “I wanted to go back to what I had done when Apollo was much smaller.” T he rise of any asset class is often easy to understand in hindsight, but when Harris first became interested in sports ownership after Apollo’s 2011 IPO gave the billionaire newfound liquidity, it was far from a sure thing that franchise values would continue to go up. The NBA was having a particularly difficult year, dealing with a dispute with its players’ union over revenue sharing that came to a head in a five-month lockout, shortening the 2011-12 season. “This was post-Michael Jordan, and people were saying maybe the best years of this league were behind us. Certainly, we didn’t believe that, but that’s what a lot of people in the market were saying,” says NBA commissioner Adam Silver, then the league’s deputy commissioner under David Stern. “Josh took a long-term view, and he was very analytical in his approach. He did as thorough a due diligence process with the league as any owner had done in my time in the league up till then, and I got here in 1992.” BILLIONAIRES’ PLAYGROUND NFL teams have grown in value much faster and more regularly than stocks or real estate, and they’ve even beaten private equity since the turn of the century, helping wealthy owners get even richer. The Philadelphia 76ers won their last championship in 1983, in the spring of Harris’ freshman year at Penn. He recalls marveling at how the team united and delighted the city. But ever since, the franchise had been stuck in a cycle of irrelevance. It was losing $25 million a year and attendance was sagging. Harris felt that the team’s owner, cable TV giant Comcast, was more passionate about the Flyers, the city’s hockey team, than basketball, and was open to making a deal. Harris and Blitzer, the Blackstone banker whom Harris had befriended while working in London during the fin­ancial crisis, pulled a page from their day jobs to orchestrate a corporate carve-out for $280 million to acquire the team with a group of investors made up of mostly Penn alumni and Philadelphia natives who remembered the Sixers’ 1980s heyday. “I remember David Stern saying, ‘You don’t realize how good a deal you’re getting’—as he insisted we pay more in revenue share,” Harris says. After acquiring the team, Harris decided the way out of mediocrity was to first get worse. He oversaw the rebuil­ding phase in which the team traded veterans for future draft picks and earned its own high draft picks with poor play on the court. The dark period coined a forlorn rallying cry that fans would chant at games: “Trust the Process.” Unfortunately, it took longer than Harris envisioned, with five straight losing seasons from 2012 to 2017. But it eventually worked. Philly has made the playoffs in each of the last seven years and fans have come back in droves, selling out every game since 2017. “The Sixers are a top-quartile franchise in the NBA. Philly cares about sports. They’re tough and they’re demanding,” Harris says. “And Washington is a top-quartile franchise in the NFL. If you just do the right thing, you know you’re going to make money in those franchises.” That’s why the cost of admission to the NFL didn’t dissuade him. The league makes around $10 billion per year from its media rights deals, a number Harris expects to rise significantly when it renegotiates its contracts following the 2028-29 season. According to Nielsen, 93 of the 100 most-watched TV shows of 2023 were NFL games—and three of the other seven were college football games. An average of 17.9 million people watched run-of-the-mill regular season games last year, while a record 120 million tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII. Compare that to nationally televised NBA games garnering 1.6 million eyeballs on average. The NBA still inked an 11-year, $76 billion TV deal in July that will take the league through 2036. “The NBA media deal per viewer hour is now multiples of the NFL deal,” Harris says. “It does feel like there’s upward pressure on the NFL media deal.” More than half of NFL team controlling owners are over age 70. A major intergenerational wealth transfer is looming. It’s not as if NFL owners have to pinch pennies until the media rights are up for renewal. The NFL pools its TV revenue, plus sales from leaguewide sponsorships and merchandising. That money is distributed equally to its 32 teams. Each team also contributes 34% of its ticket sales to the general pool. That helps smaller-market franchises stay competitive. Last year, each NFL outfit received $400 million from the league, covering around two-thirds of annual revenue for a typical team. It’s a type of corporate socialism that guarantees every team will make heaps of money. According to Forbes’ estimates, every NFL team netted at least $50 million in operating income last year, and most exceeded $100 million. Whether you win the Super Bowl or are stuck in last place hardly matters. The Caro­lina Panthers have had an abysmal record on the field since Tepper bought them in 2018. But the team has still doubled in value, with an estimated $109 million in operating income last year. Harris’ Commanders were the worst in their division in 2023 but had strong 26% operating margins, making an estimated $160 million on $609 million in revenue, net of stadium debt service. “If there’s a recession, your chemical company, your steel company, the stuff I used to do, they’ll be hit,” Harris says. “In the NFL, to a large extent, 70% of the revenues are contracted, and then you have the 30% that might be hit a little, but it’s very non-correlated.” Profits are not as much of a sure thing in the National Hockey League, but that hasn’t stopped valuations from rising. Harris’ New Jersey Devils are worth $1.45 billion, 4.5 times more than his $320 million 2013 purchase price. Things are even better for NBA owners. Forbes now values the 76ers at $4.3 billion, 15 times what Harris’ group paid for them. H arris isn’t just sitting back

Following Sep 30, 2024, 11:12am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline A win in November’s presidential election from Republican candidate Donald Trump could throw a wrench in the Chinese stock market’s explosive recent performance, cautioned JPMorgan Chase strategists in a Monday note to clients, dousing seemingly unfettered optimism surrounding the world’s second-largest equity market. Chinse stocks are red hot. AFP via Getty Images Key Facts “We look to fade this rebound for now,” wrote a group led by Mislav Matejka, the bank’s head of global and European equity strategy, referring broadly to emerging market stocks after the MSCI emerging markets index’s 6% gain in September, led primarily by the surge from China, by far its largest country by weight. The JPMorgan strategists said they are “unexcited about the China economy” despite the recent fervor, but it’s not just fundamentals driving the lukewarm tune for emerging markets. If Trump prevails in November, the bank expects emerging market stocks “will be a laggard, at least initially,” referencing the group’s 10% underperformance compared to developed market stocks in the two months following the 2016 election. The Trump risk for emerging market stocks, tied to his hawkish trade policies especially toward China, may be a headwind, but after the U.S. election passes, JPMorgan said they’d consider upgrading the group, noting emerging market stocks could be at a “turning point” as they recover following 30% underperformance compared to developed market equities since Jan. 2021. Big Number 27%. That’s how much the Chinese stock index CSI 300 is up over the last two weeks. Key Background Chinese stocks’ massive rally raged on Monday, as the CSI 300’s 8.5% gain was its best day since Sept. 2008, according to FactSet data. After falling to a five-year low earlier this month, the Chinese stock resurgence came as Beijing rolled out a variety of stimulatory measures designed to jumpstart its economy and stock market, such as interest rate cuts and stock buyback incentive programs. The JPMorgan note reflects a common view that the major rebound may not have the required foundation; Bank of America’s lead China equity strategist wrote Friday “the Investors we spoke to generally have low conviction in the sustainability of the rally.” Trump has floated a 50% tariff on U.S. imports on Chinese goods. China accounted for about a quarter of the MSCI emerging markets index at the end of last month and is by far the largest economy considered an emerging market, with the U.S., Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom among those considered developed markets (you may be familiar with the terms from your 401K account elections). Chief Critic David Tepper , the billionaire investor considered one of the best hedge fund managers in history, is among those all in on Chinese stocks, telling CNBC last Thursday he’s buying “everything” he can tied to Chinese equities.

Jim Grant says Warren Buffett is warning us about US stocks by pivoting to this 1 asset class. Should you? Read full article Jing Pan Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:01 PM 5 min read Link Copied 121 In this article: Jim Grant says Warren Buffett is warning us about US stocks by pivoting to this 1 asset class. Should you? Momentum in the U.S. stock market appears relentless. After a remarkable 24% surge in the S&P 500 in 2023, the index has climbed another 20% in 2024, despite some temporary setbacks earlier in the year. Amid this bullish backdrop, Jim Grant, editor of “Grant’s Interest Rate Observer,” issued a pointed caution for investors. Don't miss Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how “We shouldn't forget that it is at an all time [high], almost everything, price [to] earnings, price [to] book, price [to] sales, what have you, and nor should we forget that the greatest equity investor is about ready to show a balance sheet that's 50-50, with more T-bills than stocks,” he said in an interview with Fox Business. Grant was alluding to investing legend Warren Buffett, implying that Buffett’s pivot toward safer assets like Treasury bills — short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with maturities of one year or less — may be a red flag for investors. “When the greatest equity investor owns more bills than equities, one at least is advised to step back and say, if this is perfection, how does it improve?” Grant warned, suggesting that investors consider the potential risks of an overheated market. Buffett’s cash reserve Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stakes in several major holdings this year. For instance, in Q2, Berkshire sold 389 million shares of its top holding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), cutting its position by 49.3%. It also reduced its stake in Capital One (NYSE:COF) by 21.3%, offloading 2.65 million shares. Additionally, a more recent filing reveals that Berkshire trimmed its stake in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) down to 10.5% in Q3. While Berkshire did make some purchases in Q2, it sold far more than it bought, marking the seventh consecutive quarter as a net seller of stocks. As a result, the company is sitting on a substantial cash reserve. As of June 30, 2024, Berkshire’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills totaled $271.5 billion. What’s particularly noteworthy is the vast amount Berkshire has allocated to Treasury bills. By the end of June, Berkshire held a whopping $234.618 billion in Treasury bills. Story continues That’s more than the U.S. Federal Reserve's Treasury bill holdings, which stood at $195.293 billion as of September 25. Still, Buffett held a larger position in stocks. As of the end of June, Berkshire’s investments in equity securities totaled $284.871 billion, reflecting its continued substantial exposure to the stock market. Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead Why is Buffett holding so much cash? Berkshire's massive cash position has sparked questions about why Buffett isn’t seizing more investment opportunities. After all, as Grant noted, Buffett is often hailed as the world’s greatest investor. From 1964 to 2023, Berkshire achieved an extraordinary overall gain of 4,384,748%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 31,223% over the same period. Buffett has addressed the cash concern, explaining his cautious approach during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year. “I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated , emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.” Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.” While some see Berkshire’s cash hoard as a defensive stance against a potential market downturn, others interpret it differently. Fund manager Chris Bloomstran told Business Insider that the situation is more nuanced. He noted that Berkshire’s large insurance operations necessitate a substantial cash reserve to cover potential payouts. Moreover, given Berkshire’s size, its range of suitable investments is limited. Bloomstran pointed out that with Treasury bills offering decent yields, Buffett can afford to be patient. “He's limited to maybe the 100 biggest companies in the S&P 500 and maybe a handful of international businesses to be able to invest in,” Bloomstran explained. “So, his opportunity set is expensive, but he doesn't mind earning 5.3% in the interim, but it does not mean in any way, shape, or form that a stock market crash is imminent. He's just trying to find great prices stable enough to put money to work. His universe is limited.” Of course, financial prudence has always been a cornerstone of Buffett’s philosophy. In his recent letter to shareholders, Buffett emphasized that Berkshire “holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill position far in excess of what conventional wisdom deems necessary.” This conservative approach could prove to be a significant advantage during times of financial turmoil. Buffett highlighted that during the 2008 financial crisis, Berkshire generated cash through its operations, without relying on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets in any capacity. “We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis, but we were always prepared for one,” Buffett said, underscoring the importance of maintaining liquidity in uncertain times.

Matt also oversees the global streaming platform that Peacock and other services at NBCU run on, and I wanted to know that big tech investment is generating the kind of economies of scale that really pay off over time — stuff that tech companies think about all the time, but media companies have had to learn. One thing I really wanted to talk to Matt about was how Peacock handled the Olympics this year — it felt like things really clicked for the platform in Paris over the summer, and the idea that all the coverage could be served up in multiple different formats on demand and live really worked. It turns out that a lot of these ideas have been brewing for a long time — for a decade or more in some cases. There’s a lot in this one — tech, media, sports, and culture, all at once. It’s quite a ride. Our usual disclosure before we start — NBCU is an investor in The Verge ’s parent company, Vox Media, but they have no control over our newsroom, and I remain free to demand NFL games in 4K HDR of their executives on my show whenever I want. You’re on the hook now, Matt. Okay, Matt Strauss, head of direct-to-consumer at NBCUniversal. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Matt Strauss, you are the chairman of direct-to-consumer at NBCUniversal. Welcome to Decoder . Thank you, Nilay. It’s good to be here. That is a very formal title. It sounds like you sit in a leather chair in a boardroom and just sort of issue edicts. What it means to me is that you oversee Peacock. Is that really the scope of it? It’s a little bit broader than that. To give you a little bit of background, I actually have just celebrated my 20-year anniversary at Comcast, and so I’ve been at the company for quite a long time. And when I came to Comcast, I actually came there as cable was transitioning from analog to digital, and it gave way to the two-way connectivity that ultimately built things like on-demand. On-demand technology is something I’ve been very passionate about my entire career and was really focused on how I built that out for Comcast and spent quite a number of years doing that. We ultimately launched the X1 platform, which was Comcast’s IP set-top box, because we realized that the future was on-demand that was going to give people instant gratification, and we needed a platform to allow people ultimate control, that they could navigate all these on-demand choices, and X1 became the platform where we did that. And it really was ahead of its time because it aggregated live and on-demand and DVR and even apps and made them all really seamless for consumers, including the ability to navigate them with your voice with the voice remote, which was before even Siri and Alexa — like we were experimenting with voice. I think as my career there kind of grew and I took on more of the role of overseeing the residential services at Comcast, which included video and broadband and phone, I got a call one day to come to NBC, which obviously is a subsidiary of Comcast, and I got a call from Steve Burke, who at the time was the CEO, and he had asked if I would come there to help them build a streaming service and take it to market, and I got that call on a Thursday, and on Monday, I showed up in New York City with my suitcase, and I was ready to go. And what’s very common inside of large companies in my experience is that when you’re trying to build something new, it’s common to almost incubate it. You kind of create resources. You put a little bit of a fence around it because you don’t want the day-to-day activity necessarily interfering with the ambition of trying to build a new business, and Peacock was the same inside of NBC. What I realized early on was that there’s lots of other businesses within NBC that actually are very complimentary and can help get us more scale, can help de-risk the execution and the ambition we had with Peacock, for example. NBC owns Fandango, which is one of the largest ticketing companies. They own Voodoo, which is now called Fandango at Home, which has a catalog of 250,000 titles for digital purchase and rental. They own Rotten Tomatoes, which is certainly known for movie and TV reviews. They also — everyone’s familiar with NBC and a lot of the cable networks that we have in the United States, but NBC distributes their networks in almost every country around the world. We recognized that if we could aggregate all of these businesses under one portfolio, it actually could give us even more economies of scale, and that’s what we started to do. And so the umbrella of direct-to-consumers, Peacock is certainly a big piece of it, but all these other businesses — the global businesses and these other digital businesses — now sit under this D2C umbrella, and they each have their own individual P&Ls, but in the aggregate, they reach 100 million users, they generate billions of dollars of revenue, and they also… they’re available in over 70 countries around the world. I think that that is the portfolio that I’m now managing. How we then leverage that portfolio is something that I’ve been trying to build out over the last few years around again, trying to build one product team, one technology team, one decision sciences research team, etc., to give us kind of these centers of excellence inside of NBC as we continue to roll out our digital plans for direct-to-consumer. You’re on Decoder , so I’m absolutely going to ask you about how all of that is structured and how all of those individual P&Ls fight for resources. But I want to just take one step back and focus on the transition you mentioned from Comcast to NBC to direct-to-consumer. In the TV world, we’re broadly going from a place where big cable companies like Comcast or Spectrum or whatever had big regional physical infrastructure monopolies. You had these natural monopolies because you had wires in the ground going to everyone’s houses. You were the distributor, the video providers would come to you and you would resell those services, and that was a pretty good business for everyone. Now we’re at a place where there’s multiple ways to get programming over the internet, whether it’s wireless, whether it’s fiber in the ground, whether it’s still the cable network, whether it’s other forms of broadband like Starlink, and the distributors don’t have as much power over the suppliers because the suppliers can get to consumers in lots of different ways. That’s the transition that you’re mentioning, and it has really disrupted the whole industry. How do you see Peacock fitting into this at the end? Is it going to be as good of a business as the cable business was once upon a time? Because it feels like everyone is searching for a business that good. There’s no question that the cable business is a good business and continues to be a good business . I think to answer the question, you almost need to look at it through the lens of the consumer. And what I’ve learned is there really are different cohorts of how people consume video, how they subscribe to video. So, for example, the cable customer tends to watch a lot of TV. The average consumer watches about five hours a day ; if you subscribe to cable, you typically watch that much, if not more. And there’s a lot of benefit of having cable because, as I mentioned, if you have the X1 platform, there’s a simplicity of just having all the choices in one place. It works with 99.99 percent reliability. In many cases, people are also subscribing to the bundle, so they’re getting video, but then they’re also getting internet, and in some cases, they’re getting their wireless. And even though people tend to say they like a la carte, bundling has a lot of virtue because the more you take, the better the price. People who subscribe to cable and satellite today, it’s not that they’re not aware of other choices — they’re paying in some cases, for that convenience in that reliability. They also tend to over index in subscribing to streaming services. It’s not one or the other. In many cases, you’re seeing that customer buying both. That’s one part of the market. You have another part of the market, which might be more price sensitive, maybe does not consume as much video. In some cases, they might watch video, but they might be spending more time on social media or video gaming or how else they’re occupying their time, and they like the flexibility of being able to subscribe to a subset of services. And in many ways, that’s what direct-to-consumer is offering. There is a Venn diagram, though, here, where as a media company, you want to cast a broad enough net where you’re providing a value proposition for one segment, which is like the content carnivore but, at the same time, offering the optionality, and in some cases, with direct-to-consumer, but in many cases, there’s an overlap between the two. When you look at it as a portfolio, which is really how we manage the business in NBC, it’s not direct-to-consumer sits outside of the broadcast and the linear and the cable networks; it’s actually all one group, and we manage it as a portfolio. And there’s examples where that comes to life like the Olympics, but I think that we are kind of looking at it in totality and that it’s about giving customers choice and options, and that’s how we see ourselves growing. If pay-TV declines and cord cutting grows, we still want to service the customers who have paid TV, but at the same time, we recognize that the growth over the next foreseeable future is going to continue to come from direct-to-consumer. The last time I was a Comcast customer was 15 years ago. I lived in Chicago, and everyone I knew was a Comcast customer. That was the choice in my building and most of the neighborhoods that my friends lived in. We all also got internet from Comcast because of what you’re describing — the bundle. There was not another thing; it was just the easiest next thing to do. When you describe direct-to-consumer, that’s another distribution method, right? You’re going literally directly to the consumer and charging them money and then giving them services directly, and you manage the customer relationship. Is that the part that’s going to grow, versus the experience I had when I was a Comcast customer and I would watch NBC 5 in Chicago, but Comcast owned the relationship with me? I think when you kind of study the pay-TV ecosystem and the trajectory of pay-TV, I think it’s consistently been declining year over year, and I don’t think anybody really knows at what point does it start to flatten out? But I do believe that there’s always going to be a fairly large group of people who are willing to pay a premium for cable for all the reasons that I said before. And so I think that’s still going to be a very, very large part of the TV viewing and TV households viewing. But yes, I mean, direct-to-consumer is where we’re really projecting the growth to come from. I actually think that there’s a lot of signs of what I’ve learned in the cable business that I see happening in the direct-to-consumer business that, in some ways, it’s going to be, I think, back to the future. And what I mean by that is that people who maybe did cut the cord, part of the rationale I believe was because they thought they were going to save money by going and just getting some streaming services. And to a certain extent, that was true for some period of time, but it was very predictable that the cost of content hasn’t gone down, the cost of sports rights haven’t gone down. It was inevitable that prices of streaming services were going to have to increase. And we’ve seen that as an industry over the past 18 to 24 months, where streaming services have continued to take their rates up in an effort to drive more profitability. By the way, we’re not excluded from that. I mean, we took a price increase over the summer. I think that that was a very predictable outcome. The other predictable outcome, from my point of view, is what I said earlier, which is people watch more video than they really know. If you look at the Nielsen numbers, the amount of time that people spend watching video has been fairly consistent over the past decade. If you cut the cord and you sign up for a streaming service, you’re unlikely going to get your video calories as a consumer from one service. What happens is you subscribe to two, three, and now the average consumer is subscribing to four or five services. You take these two things together, where I’m subscribing now to four or five services, the rates are continuing to go up. In some cases, you may be asking yourself: Wait, I might be paying more and possibly getting less than what I got when I subscribed to cable. And I think that these are the ingredients in the marketplace that is driving the market to bundling . And we had talked about this, I had talked about this five years ago that we’re likely going to see an explosion of streaming and direct-to-consumer, only to then find it almost reaggregate itself under a new bundle. And I think there’s obviously a lot of evidence over the last two years where that’s exactly what’s been happening. And I think that, so again, in many ways, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re going to still have people who subscribe to cable or streaming or both, but I think that direct-to-consumer is going to be a very important component, but I think increasingly direct-to-consumer, and direct-to-consumer as part of a bundling construct, is going to likely be how many people over time are subscribing to these different services, which, again, is ironically back to where everything started with cable television. Are you seeing the growth in the bundling, and are you able to maintain the customer relationship as the bundles grow? I’m thinking specifically of my customer relationship with your competitor, Max, which is somehow to this day still mediated by my

When George Coulam decided to retire, he had a problem. He owned the Texas Renaissance Festival — which bills itself as the largest such gathering in America, drawing over 500,000 annual visitors — and he needed to find a successor. Several longtime associates were eager to take over, but Coulam had run the fair for decades; he wanted his pride and joy to land in the right hands. Suitor after suitor put in bids to buy the business, but none felt like the right fit. Across the US, older business owners are arriving at the same juncture. Over half of small businesses — those with a single owner and fewer than 500 employees — are owned by people over 50. The wealth-management firm NewEdge Wealth has estimated that boomer-owned businesses in the US are worth about $10 trillion. Those boomers can't retire and enjoy their sunset years until they figure out what to do with their businesses . Can a relative or longtime employee take over? Should they shut down? Or can they sell? For millennials with the entrepreneurial bug, this boomer retirement bomb could be a boon. As they enter their prime wealth-building years, many are anxious about how they'll save up for retirement ; in a turbulent housing market , buying an existing business offers a tantalizing opportunity. The market-research firm Forrester found in a survey it conducted last year that 64% of people buying businesses were millennials or younger. Sure, many small businesses aren't glamorous — think dental practices or accounting firms — and they involve long hours and unpredictable market forces. But they might just be a better pathway to retirement than building a business from scratch. Advertisement Private-equity firms have long seen the wisdom in acquiring small businesses. Why should they be the only ones reaping the fruits of boomer labor? In the late 1990s, Nancy Forster-Holt, an accountant at Ernst & Young, was transferred from Sacramento, California, to Maine. She fell in love with the state and her now-husband, Steve Holt. They decided to buy a business together. Since she had experience as a chief financial officer and he was an engineer, they focused on manufacturing companies. They soon found Shaw & Tenney, a century-and-a-half-old manufacturer of wooden paddles and oars in Orono. Before the Holts bought it in 2003, Shaw & Tenney had had only two other owners: the Tenney family, which operated it until 1978, and Paul and Helen Reagan. When they decided to retire two years ago, the Holts thought their children might want to take over. But no one showed any interest. "They all grew up in it and worked in it," Forster-Holt, who's also a clinical associate professor at the University of Rhode Island's business school, told me. "Our last one graduated in 2022, and he's a food scientist, and we're a manufacturer of oars and paddles." The couple realized they had to sell, and they started marketing the company while planning the graduation party. That's when Jennifer and Neil Gutekunst came along. When they acquired Shaw & Tenney in 2023, they had two other small businesses under their belt. They took what the Holts built — a recognized brand, equipment, a highly skilled workforce, and customer relationships — and ran with it. Advertisement "The businesses we purchased all had cash day one," Neil Gutekunst said. Neither of the Gutekunsts had a sales background, but the three companies they purchased had strong customer bases and solid reputations. All they had to do was keep things running. The US Small Business Administration said in July that there were nearly 35 million small businesses in the US. The vast majority of those, 82%, had no employees other than the owner, meaning they probably wouldn't make sense to sell. But each year, about 65,000 of the remaining chunk of businesses are listed on BizBuySell, an online listing service of businesses for sale. Related stories Edie Ellis, who runs a consulting firm in Chicago and has advised industrial companies on acquisitions, said the peak of small-business sales began when baby boomers started to turn 60, in about 2006. Many owners found that their children didn't want to take over, so they looked for buyers. The kids of small-business owners "run the opposite direction, because they saw the lifestyle," Ellis said. "They saw that mom and dad worked 24/7, they didn't have a weekend off, you know? They don't want to do that." Data from BizBuySell indicates that sales of small businesses have been lower since the 2006 peak and dipped during the pandemic, but quarterly transaction volume has largely recovered from 2020 and has held steady. In the second quarter of this year, BizBuySell had listings for over 35,000 businesses with a median asking price of $395,000 and a median revenue of over $700,000 — meanwhile, in the housing market, the median home price recently hit $412,000. Demand for these businesses is growing, pushing the median sales price up 25% over last year. While not all of these companies will be a good investment, the right venture could offer an edge over more traditional wealth-building routes. The upside of buying an existing small business, besides inheriting foundational elements — a brand, suppliers, systems, and customers — is that financing an acquisition is often easier than financing a brand-new business. You don't need to have hundreds of thousands in cash on hand to take advantage. In some cases, sellers are willing to assist in financing because they want the business out of their hands. Some will accept deferred compensation or a share of future earnings as a way to lessen the up-front cost. Buyers with good credit can also borrow money through the Small Business Administration. Advertisement Existing companies often have assets that can help make financing easier. If the business owns land, buildings, or equipment, that can serve as collateral for a bank loan. Plus, with revenue already coming in the door, lenders know they won't have to wait to receive payment. You come to work and you've got your to-do list, and a truck has hit your building, and now your day is something completely different. Do you have the temperament for that? Of course, there are some logistical challenges in finding the right business — fewer than a quarter of the businesses listed on BizBuySell sell in a given year. For one thing, great small businesses aren't always in places where people want to move. Dave Specht, the director of the Drucker School Global Family Business Institute at Claremont Graduate University, told me that the situation is compounded when people in small towns don't want to talk to their neighbors about their plans for their businesses. "There's great secrecy around the timing of transitions and things like that," Specht, who lives in a small town in Washington, said. Often, potential buyers end up looking elsewhere. "They go to a larger town or a larger city because they just don't know." Some businesses need a buyer with a combination of skills that isn't easy to find. Some have real estate that's worth more than the rest of the assets. And some are "lifestyle companies," such as bookstores, yarn stores, and other Main Street businesses, that don't generate much profit beyond the owner's small salary. Other businesses might have hidden problems, Ellis told me. "Have they been paying their bills? Have they been paying the IRS? You don't know what you don't know," she said. Advertisement The challenges don't stop once you've made the purchase. Fewer than two-thirds of small businesses in the US in 2022 were profitable, and over a million businesses of all sizes close each year. "You get people that come up from Wall Street and they want to buy a bed-and-breakfast in Maine because they've always loved Maine," Forster-Holt said. "But guess what? They're working 24/7, 365, helping other people enjoy Maine." She's noticed that people with experience working in corporations sometimes struggle with the flat hierarchy and ever-changing priorities of a small business. "You come to work and you've got your to-do list, and a truck has hit your building, and now your day is something completely different," she said. "Do you have the temperament for that?" Related stories The Holts found that they did. "I loved working there," Forster-Holt told me. And those who can roll with a little bit of upheaval can reap the financial upsides. Private-equity firms are certainly familiar with those upsides. The American Investment Council reported that 85% of private-equity investments in 2022 were small businesses. Citing the data provider Preqin, PwC recently reported that, as of the end of May, private equity firms had $1 trillion in liquid assets that were looking for investments. These companies are interested in small businesses that operate similarly in many markets and can be rolled up together, such as plumbing or HVAC companies. Advertisement "Private equity is smart in targeting family businesses," Specht told me. "Many of them are great businesses." Fortunately for millennial buyers, many family owners would prefer not to deal with Wall Street. In 2022, Dinkel's Bakery, a beloved Chicago institution, closed after a century in business. Norm Dinkel, the third-generation owner, wanted to retire, and he couldn't find a buyer who also wanted to operate the business. Anyone fortunate enough to have had a Dinkel's chocolate doughnut or fresh strawberry paczki knows the loss. Traditionally, small businesses were family businesses, and the eldest male child was expected to take it over when the patriarch was ready to step down. That got Dinkel's through a hundred years of operation. Many small-business owners want to keep the company in the family, said Brian Brogan, who works as a wealth advisor to family-business owners and teaches in the family-business program at Saint Joseph's University in Pennsylvania. If that isn't an option, they look for someone they can trust to carry on the business. Even if you can't plan on receiving an inheritance, you can create one for yourself (and your own children). Coulam, the owner of the Texas Renaissance Festival, is slightly older than the average boomer business owner — he's entering his late 80s. But even he hasn't found a suitable buyer. His succession search, which was documented in the recent HBO series "Ren Faire," highlights the difficulty of passing along a business someone spent their whole life building. With small businesses especially, it's not just about the numbers — it's a very personal decision. Advertisement Still, for buyers able to find the right match, snatching up an existing business could be a smart move. For the Gutekunsts, one acquisition intended as a lifestyle change has turned into a collection of businesses built around southern Maine's deep tradition of woodcrafting. "It's fun," Jennifer Gutekunst tells me. It also beats not having a satisfying retirement plan. Last year I wrote about the myth of the "Great Boomer Wealth Transfer " — about how most boomers don't have many assets to pass along, and those that do are likely to get eaten up by the high cost of elder care. But even if you can't plan on receiving an inheritance, you can create one for yourself (and your own children). Buying up small businesses allows people without wealthy boomer parents to cash in on the trillions of dollars of wealth the generation is sitting on. Ann C.

Chevron Corporation (CVX): Warren Buffett’s Stock Recommended by Analysts Read full article Neha Gupta Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 11:09 PM 6 min read Link Copied 4 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy. 2024 will go down in history as the year that legendary investor Warren Buffett started showing signs of slowing down after an illustrious career in the investment world. After losing his best friend and longtime partner, Charlie Munger, the Oracle of Omaha increasingly shows signs of relinquishing control of his investment empire. Even with his investment company becoming the first non-tech giant to hit the $1 trillion mark on market cap, Buffett is slowly relinquishing control after years of tremendous success. Handpicked Greg Abel is now responsible for taking over the Buffett Empire after more than 60 years in the limelight. READ ALSO: Carl Icahn Stock Portfolio: 7 Best Stocks to Buy and 10 Best Performing Warren Buffett Stocks in 2024 . As Abel assumes control in making key investment decisions, Buffett continues sending shockwaves. Nevertheless, he has become a net seller, having trimmed stakes in some high-profile holdings, all but raising concerns about the market outlook. At 94, Buffett has seen it all, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the years and generated significant returns for his investors. Since 1965, the billionaire investor has averaged returns of 19.8% through his investment firm, nearly double the 10.2% return of the S&P 500 over the same period. Nevertheless, he appears to have hit the peak of his investment career as he became a net seller after one of the longest bull runs. The recent sales have taken Buffett’s cash haul to the $300 billion mark, which he can use to purchase a good chunk of the S&P 500 companies. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has shown reluctance to invest in the cash-sitting valuations that have gotten out of hand. Since Buffett has yet to carry out a massive investment this year, it does not come as a surprise. The advocate of value investing, which involves analyzing the market for undervalued stocks likely to generate long-term value, has been skeptical about valuations. His reluctance also comes on outperformance in recent years, becoming extremely difficult due to the sheer size of Buffett’s investment portfolio. “We have no possibility of eye-popping performance” given that “there remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,” Buffett is quoted as saying in an interview with CNBC. Story continues With the S&P 500 up by more than 20% for the year, Buffett has indicated that the market might be too expensive to pursue opportunities at current levels. Consequently, he has opted to stay in cash while locking in profits through buybacks and dividends in some of his top investment plays. Nevertheless, the market is still full of some of the best Warren Buffett stocks that analysts see material upside to. In the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rateby 50 basis points and indicating the prospects of further cuts before year-end, opportunities are increasingly emerging around some of Buffett’s top investment plays Even as Buffett waits for the market to correct to deploy the more than $300 billion at his disposal, there are still opportunities to pursue as interest rates trend down. With that, let’s look at the 8 best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology To compile the list of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts, we sifted through Berkshire Hathaway’s Q2 2024 13F portfolio. We scanned all the 13F holdings and picked the 8 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of September 24. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ) Warren Buffett’s Q2 2024 Stake: $18.55 Billion Analyst Upside Potential, as of September 26: 23% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of Buffett’s investment plays for exposure in the energy sector. While the company has felt the full brunt of oil prices plunging from above the $80 barrel level, it remains one of the companies well poised to navigate the challenging environment. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) operates as an integrated energy firm throughout the industry, meaning it is involved in all aspects of the energy sector. This includes involvement in oil and natural gas exploration and production (upstream), the transportation of energy (midstream), and the processing of chemicals and refining (downstream). At any given moment, each of these areas of the industry can show varying levels of performance. The company’s competitive edge stems from having a balance sheet capable of weathering down any energy industry cycle while continuing to reward investors with dividends. Additionally, the company boasts of one of the lowest debt-to-equity ratios of 0.15 as it pays more attention to its balance sheet. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) can increase its financial strength when the oil price falls, enabling the company to keep investing in its operations and distributing dividends. It’s worth noting that the dividend has risen for an impressive 37 years straight, marking an extraordinary achievement considering Chevron’s competitive industry. As oil prices rise again, as they invariably do, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) decreases its financial exposure to prepare for the next economic slump. For conservative investors seeking a reliable energy stock that can weather any storm, finding a more attractive alternative than Chevron’s 4.5% dividend yield would be challenging. The stock commands an average buy rating on Wall Street with a $177.08 price target, implying 23% upside potential. In the second quarter of 2024, 64 hedge funds held positions in the stock, with total stakes reaching $22.41 billion. By June 30, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest shareholder, holding a position valued at $18.55 billion. In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter , Diamond Hill Capital’s Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy commented on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX): “Other bottom contributors included Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Carrier Global and Becton, Dickinson. Shares of integrated oil and gas company Chevron were pressured as global oil production is growing — particularly in the US, which has now surpassed its past production levels — in turn pressuring oil prices and company profit margins.” Overall CVX ranks 3rd on our list of 8 Best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Advertisement DirecTV knows it needs leverage to survive in a cutthroat TV industry marred by cord-cutting, so it's joining forces with one of its biggest rivals . Two decades of flirting between DirecTV and Dish Network culminated in a long-rumored deal unveiled on Monday. DirecTV will absorb $9.8 billion worth of Dish's debt, and private-equity firm TPG will own all of the satellite-TV giant after buying AT&T's stake in a separate move. The timing of this tie-up between the two major satellite-TV providers is no coincidence. DirecTV is fresh off a hostile carriage dispute with Disney in which its customers went without channels like ESPN and ABC for nearly two weeks at the start of football season, which is a huge driver of pay-TV sign-ups. The companies eventually reached a truce in which each seemed to secure concessions, though it won't be clear who won until details are finalized. Advertisement Like all pay-TV providers, DirecTV has been crushed by cord-cutting for the last decade or more. The satellite titan hopes to stem the tide by offering skinnier, genre-based bundles and streaming services at no extra cost , though industry observers doubt those moves can reverse declines . But unlike Charter and Comcast, which have broadband businesses they can fall back on, DirecTV has no clear backup plan outside the pay-TV bundle. Related stories With this in mind, media companies may try to push around DirecTV. That's one reason the TV provider negotiated so aggressively with Disney and even went on offense by teaming up with rival Dish. The move might not be a home run, but it could help DirecTV at least avoid a strikeout. "I don't know that it's a game-changer," Corey Martin, chair of entertainment law firm Granderson Des Rochers's Entertainment Finance Practice, said of the deal in an interview with BI. "I think it allows them to continue to have a seat at the table for the foreseeable future." Advertisement DirecTV may need to fight to survive DirecTV has a survival plan: It wants to become the ultimate middleman between content providers and consumers. It hopes to endure by putting traditional TV channels and streaming services in one place and establishing itself as the central interface, similar, in some respects, to how Spotify pools together music from major labels. It's also similar to the pitch made by TV operating system heavyweights like Roku and Amazon. "We need some aggregator in the space who can bring all of your content together that you actually want to watch, not based on the studio that creates it," Jon Greer, the head of communications for DirecTV, told Business Insider. While streaming has given consumers tons of entertainment options, it has also created headaches. There's so much content that it can be tough to find quality shows and movies, and the fragmented landscape can be difficult to navigate. Sports fans have it particularly hard, especially since the launch of sports streaming service Venu was blocked in late August. DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow said to investors and analysts in a webinar on Monday that while customers love watching shows on demand and on the platform of their choice, "they are pained with the idea of how the pricing works, how to account-manage across multiple subscriptions, about where to find their content and navigate each individual portal differently." Advertisement These issues, plus streamers' steadily rising prices, have helped bundles mount a comeback . And early evidence suggests that offerings like the Max-Hulu-Disney+ bundle are popular . DirecTV's fantasy is that consumers get fed up with paying for a litany of services and turn to them for a one-stop solution. Implicit in the satellite provider's strategy is the assumption that media companies need their help to build highly profitable direct-to-consumer businesses. "This will again allow us to work with the programmers in a way that isn't so much about bullying," Morrow said. "This is about collaboration." Advertisement But there's a space between bullying and collaboration, which is where the relationship between TV distributors and programmers usually stands. In that context, DirecTV's tie-up with Dish could give it the leverage it needs to try to turn its future vision into reality. "The programmer relationship is pretty lopsided where they know their market power, they exercise their market power," Greer said. "We never want to do that, but we need to be able to have the scale to be able to have these different conversations with programmers."

If our list is anything to go by, you have to be an intensely hardworking, intellectually curious team player who's willing to go the distance to drive the biggest deals, win the most sought-after clients, or build the most successful businesses. Every year , Business Insider taps its contacts to put together a list of who to watch on Wall Street. For the past seven years, we've received recommendations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and financial industry experts to create our annual feature. We ask that nominees be based in the US, be 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers to be eligible. The editors make the final decisions. These young professionals reflect the future of finance. A number of them are shaping the future of clean energy and artificial intelligence by financing the infrastructure that will underpin it. Some have seen their focus go from niche to hot asset. Others are influencing how Wall Street interacts with Main Street, using their skills and savvy to create new products and services for ordinary investors or giving employees at portfolio companies ownership stakes . Advertisement Business Insider asked these rising stars from leading firms like JPMorgan, Bridgewater, and Apollo to reflect on their successes, challenges, and best career advice. Advertisement Alissa Song, 31, KKR KKR One of the most memorable days of Song's KKR career was when the firm sold Minnesota Rubber and Plastics for $950 million in August 2022. She had served on the business' board while getting her MBA and led the monthslong sales process. The best part, however, was traveling to the firm's Plymouth, Minnesota, manufacturing plant to tell employees they'd be receiving a payout as equity holders in the company. Since trialing its employee-ownership program in 2015, KKR has awarded billions of dollars of equity to over 100,000 nonsenior management employees across more than 50 portfolio companies. The firm bet that giving portfolio company workers a piece of the private-equity pie would actually grow the size of the pie. Since graduating from Harvard in 2015, Song has worked on KKR's industrials portfolio team, which has been a proving ground for the employee-ownership program. She worked for four years on the firm's CHI Overhead Doors deal, which has become the case study for its employee-engagement model. All five deals she's worked on at KKR have an employee-ownership component. Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley after her family emigrated from China when she was 3, has long been a community builder. She rose through the ranks of Future Business Leaders of America in middle and high school to become the California state president before serving as copresident of Harvard's Undergraduate Women in Business program. Song, now a principal at the firm, said the feeling of community on the industrials team is one of the reasons she's stayed at KKR for nearly a decade. She said her friends and family were surprised she ended up investing in industrials, but she's become fascinated by the sector. "Everything that you can learn about in a business textbook, this role takes it to the real world, and I can see it in action here," Song said. Advertisement Annie Cheslin, 34, Wells Fargo Wells Fargo While researching investment-banking internships in college at Emory, Cheslin contacted a family friend who invited her to visit his trading floor and experience Wall Street for herself. It was love at first sight. "I walked onto the trading floor and never looked back," Cheslin told BI. "As soon as I walked onto the floor, heard the energy, heard the noise, I was like, 'This is somewhere that I want to be.' Maybe that sounds cliché." Today, Cheslin is a managing director in high-grade municipal trading at Wells Fargo. She joined the bank in 2012 as an analyst based in the firm's Charlotte, North Carolina, office, but later transferred to New York. She became a managing director in February. Cheslin, who's part of a team that manages billions, works with institutional clients to address their liquidity needs. She recalled an inflection point in her career in early 2022 when she was on maternity leave and the market was hit by volatility stemming from the Fed's interest-rate hikes . She recalled returning to work in what she characterized as a "completely different market landscape." But the team pulled through and logged a record year. "Knowing that I was a visible part of the effort to grow Wells Fargo's market share and to be growing our municipal franchise to be one of the top sales and trading desks on the Street is something that I'm incredibly proud of," she added. She said one key quality that's helped fuel her rise is staying open to whatever work opportunity has come her way. "Being visible not only on your desk as someone who is willing to do any task — I think that's the mindset that I've tried to keep from analyst to managing director is that I'm never bigger than any task that I would do myself." Advertisement Austin Anton, 32, Apollo Global Management Apollo Anton got an early start in finance, buying stocks in high school during the 2008 financial crisis. Some bets, like buying Bank of America stock at its trough, paid off. (He chalks up less-successful bets, such as one on Bear Stearns, to experience.) This introduction came in handy for his first job after college as a financial institutions group analyst at Credit Suisse's investment bank. He spent two years there and another two at Kohlberg and Company before joining Apollo in 2018. The 32-year-old principal's work runs the gamut from insurance to agriculture. He helped raise capital for Apollo's retirement services unit, Athene, by developing a fundraising strategy that allows third parties to invest alongside the firm. These funding vehicles, or "sidecars," have raised $9.3 billion in committed capital as of June 30. Anton was also Apollo's day-to-day lead on Vallourec, the French steel giant. Apollo sold its 28% stake for 955 million euros, about $1.04 billion, in March. Anton helped lead the acquisition of Vallourec during the COVID-19 pandemic and the firm's restructuring, which included moving operations from Germany to Brazil. He anticipates more opportunistic metals deals on the horizon as prices decline. Anton, who majored in history at Princeton, credits his versatility to his fondness for learning about different sectors and the successes and failures in each field. "A lot of stuff has been done before," he said. "If you have the curiosity and build up your knowledge of the past, I've found that to be really beneficial as you think about covering new sectors or moving to a new job." As Apollo courts wealthy individuals, Anton is developing new investment products that allow the firm to partially cash out quarterly or monthly in exchange for somewhat lower returns. Apollo sells about $1 billion a month in semiliquid products spanning private credit and real assets. "It's going to be a really big growth area for the firm," he said. Advertisement Ben Carper, 34, Jefferies Jefferies Carper has spent his career carving out a specialty in a niche area of finance: continuation vehicles, also known as "secondaries." He helps private-equity firms raise new funds to purchase companies they already own — giving existing investors a return while keeping the company's current management team and extending the life cycle of the asset for the PE firm. "Effectively, what we do is we help private-equity firms sell their highest-conviction, favorite portfolio companies to themselves," Carper said. He spent the first five years of his career as an investor on the buy side, including stints at Morgan Stanley and Coller Capital, before joining Lazard's private capital advisory business in 2018 and Jefferies in 2021. Earlier this year, Carper helped Vestar Capital Partners close a $1.2 billion continuation vehicle for its stake in the research company Circana. He also helped Calera Capital close a $750 million continuation vehicle for the linen and laundry service company ImageFIRST. Over Carper's career, these structures have switched from being a solution to a liquidity problem to a strategy that allows PE firms to hold on to some of their best portfolio companies and raise new capital, he said. When he entered the industry, he estimated there was less than $10 billion in continuation-vehicle volume annually. Now, there's more than $60 billion, and he thinks that will only grow. "I'm really excited to say that I think as a portion of the overall ecosystem, it's quite likely to grow," he said. "There's a lot of capital that is being formed to attack the opportunity right now." Advertisement Blake Cecil, 32, Bridgewater Associates Bridgewater Associates Cecil, one of two deputy chief investment officers at $108 billion Bridgewater Associates, was so ready to work full time at the firm that he dropped out of Columbia University to jump-start his career. "The thing I really liked was the intensity, the competitive nature of markets, the authenticity of Bridgewater's culture," Cecil, who first interned at the firm before joining full time in 2017, said. In his current role, he works closely with co-CIO Greg Jensen to gather insights and research from different teams and turn them into trades for the flagship strategy, Pure Alpha, which was up more than 14% through the first half of the year. "The oversight is about innovation — what's the big thing we might be missing?" Cecil said. Reams of deep research don't go far if there's not "a trader's mentality" to actually extract "a piece of alpha" from them, he said. He said he's constantly thinking about how to make sure the portfolio is "the expression of the things we believe about the world." He was promoted to his current role at the start of this year after making his name at the firm with his research on currencies. That background has pushed him to search beyond stock and bond markets for alpha — and to consider how different assets will work in a single portfolio. "There's a lot more room for us to think about how all these asset classes come together," he said. Advertisement Chi Chen, 34, BlackRock BlackRock Being named a portfolio manager of BlackRock's Total Return Fund in 2022, alongside the managers Rick Rieder and David Rogal, was a defining moment for Chen. "Becoming a named PM — it is incredible," Chen told BI. "I see that as a result of the ongoing contribution that I have had toward this set of funds and to the group." Chen calls herself a BlackRock lifer. She's been at the company 13 years and started out as an intern in the same fixed-income investment division she's currently in — only now she's comanaging a total of $60 billion across BlackRock's core, core plus, and global government portfolio mandates and leading research efforts for US rates. The Total Return Fund has about $20 billion in assets. Chen grew up in China and moved to the US by herself at 17 to attend high school in Ohio. She studied economics and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and joined BlackRock full time in 2012 as an analyst focusing on US interest rates. She also had a stint as a macro researcher on the economics team. BlackRock's managing director credits her rise to the quality of her research. He said she was always willing to dig deep into the data to uncover differentiated views, which the group's leaders noticed. "The intention or the motivation for me really was wanting to turn my ideas into action and see how they play out in the market," Chen said. Her parents, who spent their entire careers in China's postal service, began working in their teens and studied part time to earn college degrees. They instilled a strong work ethic and passion for learning. "They basically immersed in me to just spend time at the library," she said. "I think my mindset of always trying to explore and trying to see more of the world came from a very young age because of that." Advertisement Corey White, 35, Bank of America Bank of America White started his career working in franchising for Burger King, where his job was to bring on larger, better-capitalized franchisees, which usually turned out to be a PE firm or a family office. "The stories from the families and the entrepreneurs and the funds and their thesis were super interesting to me," he said. "So I decided to go to school and scale that up." After completing his MBA at Northwestern in 2017, White joined Bank of America's consumer and retail investment banking team in New York. He's since played a key role in introducing a new focus for Bank of America as part of its emerging growth and regional coverage team. "A lot of our strategy was to take all the resources and all the talent that we were putting against bulge-bracket opportunities and bring it to the middle market and try and find opportunities that normally Bank America would not have been as tuned in to," White said. He took "a leap of faith" and joined the team in Chicago in 2019. "It was kind of full circle, having started my career with entrepreneurs," said White, who now advises family-owned businesses, founders, and early investors in those companies to deepen the bank's relationships in private capital markets and attach that to its public capital markets business. Even in a time of muted IPOs, White led a large industrial IPO this year. In 2023, he was key in advising a large financial sponsor client in a take-private transaction in healthcare. He also helped lead a buy-side transaction for a family-owned consumer business, where Bank of America was both the advisor and financing partner to the client. He has advised on more than 30 transactions totaling over $25 billion. Since White joined the Chicago team, he has helped it grow from three to 25 people. His advice to young professionals in the industry is to "be your own feedback loop." "Don't wait for someone to tell you something did or didn't go well. Assess every situation yourself, almost obsessively think about, 'How can I have done that better?'" Advertisement Craig Kolwicz, 35,

CAA Sues Range Media Partners For "Unlawful" Stealing of Confidential Material Skip to main content By Dominic Patten Dominic Patten Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics @DeadlineDominic More Stories By Dominic ‘Blade Runner 2049’ Producers Sue “Problematic” Elon Musk & Warner Bros.

Now the Bryan Lourd -led CAA is after Range in open court for alleged theft and some big bucks. “Range is an unlicensed talent agency built on deceit,” reads the four-claim lawsuit filed September 30 in Los Angeles Superior Court. Related Stories News Prolific ‘La La Land’ Producer Automatik Merges With Range Media Partners Agencies Francois-Henri Pinault’s Artémis Closes Deal For Majority Stake In CAA – Update “Seeking a shortcut to success, Range’s initial founder, Peter Micelli (a former CAA literary agent and CAA member) found four highly paid CAA leaders to act as his accomplices: posing as loyal CAA members, sitting shoulder to shoulder in confidential CAA meetings about clients and business, all the while covertly working to benefit Range and themselves, and to harm CAA,” adds the suit, which seeks large but unspecified damages. Click to read CAA’s four-claim lawsuit. Watch on Deadline “Put simply, Range’s business model is the pursuit of unlawful profit through deception: Range skirts rules that California legislators and artists’ guilds put in place to protect those working in the entertainment industry,” the filing adds. “The core ‘trick’ of Range is that it acts as a talent agency, but labels itself a management company. Range therefore engages in lucrative transactions foreclosed to law-abiding talent agencies,” aka agencies like CAA. If the agency’s attorney’s words in the 28-page filing weren’t clear enough, the lawyers doubled down outside the docket. “CAA is prepared to prove that Range Media was formed through dishonest conduct and, as reflected in other public, pending legal proceedings about Range’s failure to comply with arbitration subpoenas, has concealed evidence of its founders’ actions,” CAA counsel Elena Baca told Deadline today of the suit filed Monday. “Peter Micelli, along with his accomplices who were at CAA while founding Range, conducted a lengthy scheme to enrich themselves in ways that violated their contracts and legal obligations to CAA, talent guild regulations, and ethical boundaries, as CAA will demonstrate in court,” the Paul Hastings LLP attorney added. “CAA will fiercely protect the agency against improper market conduct and the misuse of its confidential information.” Reps for Range, which was created by David Bugliari, Micelli and Jack Whigham, did not respond to request for comment from Deadline. If and when they do, this post will be updated. In point of fact, none of this is unexpected. A number of the accusations in the complaint have come up in the arbitration proceedings, I hear. Actually, in search of a timeline and more, CAA has stepped out of that process in part to seek greater access to documents involving Range moneyman (and New York Mets boss) Steven Cohen and former clients that jumped ship when the self-declared management company was unveiled four years ago. CAA is also seeking to force testimony from Micelli and other core members Range team in the behind-closed-doors arbitration. To that, the lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference may serve as a wedge to strongly nudge a reaction in arbitration. As this has all been going in court, Range has been pulling in investments over the last few months from John Malone’s Liberty Global and TPG founding partner David Bonderman’s family office Wildcat Capital Management as the company expands its reach and scope domestically and overseas. Over the past year and a half alone, Range has bolstered its film division by merging with La La Land production company Automatik. The company has also rolled out a sports strategy calling for the acquisition of growth-stage companies within the media rights, athlete marketing and golf verticals; and fortified its music efforts by launching a music publishing division and opening a Nashville office. Not that CAA has been standing still. This new suit comes almost a year to the day after Artemis, run by French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault (spouse of CAA client Salma Hayek), closed the deal on its estimated $7 billon purchase of a majority share of the agency. Singapore-based Temasek remains a minority investor in CAA, while CMC Capital remains a strategic partner. All added up, those big bucks and big backers are intended to give CAA the booster rockets to scale up in Hollywood and beyond as the media industry pivots into uncharted territories.

Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 hit fresh records to cap strong September, quarter Read full article Josh Schafer and Karen Friar Updated Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 11:15 PM Link Copied 336 In this article: US stocks bid farewell to the month and the quarter with fresh records as investors reacted to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell vowing to do what it takes to keep the economy humming, while signaling he won't rush future rate cuts. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose 0.4% to close at a new record, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained close to 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) finished just above the flatline, securing its latest all-time-high. Typically the cruelest month for stocks, Wall Street indexes recorded monthly wins to close out the last trading day of September. Notably, the S&P 500 notched its best year-to-date performance at September's end since 1997. The S&P also enjoyed its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021. Over the last three months, the Dow led the major indexes' gains, up 8.2%. The S&P gained 5.4%, and the Nasdaq added nearly 3%. The Federal Reserve's jumbo interest rate cut and signs of resilience in the US economy have lifted confidence, helping stocks post three weekly wins in a row. The final trading day of the month and the quarter also came with profit taking and rebalancing. Investors are now bracing for the September jobs report, due out on Friday, which is seen as posing an important test for the recent rally . The pressing question is just how quickly the labor market is slowing as the market weighs whether the Fed has acted aggressively to protect a healthy economy or to help a flailing one. "Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said in a speech before the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. His remarks come days ahead of the the crucial monthly jobs report. Powell's comments on not rushing the next round of rate decisions also lowered expectations of another jumbo cut.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) rose 0.4% to close at a new record, while the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained close to 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) finished just above the flatline, securing its latest all-time-high. Over the last three months the Dow finished up 8.2%, leading the pack. The S&P gained 5.4% and the Nasdaq added nearly 3%. Looking ahead to the rest of the week, investors are bracing for the September jobs report, due out on Friday, which is seen as posing an important test for the recent rally . The pressing question is just how quickly the labor market is slowing as the market weighs the Federal Reserve's next step after cutting rates by 50 basis points. During a speech on Monday Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed isn't in a rush to cut rates, but that officials will do what it takes to keep the economy on solid ground. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 8:46 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban A historically tough month set to ends with gains Typically a challenging month for stocks, September has turned out to be a positive one for the major gauges, rounding out a solid quarter and setting the stage for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) was on track to increase 1.4% for the month and ended the quarter up 7.8%, leading the pack. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was set to gain about 1.5% for September and just under 5% for the quarter. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) was poised to add 2% for the month and close to 2% for the quarter. The start of October could further boost the bullish mood if the next batch of economic data shows more favorable signs. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports , some analysts see the next step of the cycle as ushering in a bundle of positive factors. Any evidence that the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates amid an ideal backdrop of continuous economic growth , a solid labor market, and easing inflation would be a "hugely bullish" outcome for equities, Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser said. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 7:51 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Powell speech lowers expectations for another jumbo rate cut On Monday afternoon Fed Chair Jerome Powell vowed to do what it takes to keep the economy humming. But his remarks clarifying that the central bank is not on a predetermined path, and isn't in a rush to quickly cut rates also appeared to lower expectations for another 50 basis point cut. Market bets for another half-percent cut dropped to 35% Monday afternoon, compared to 53% a day ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there," Powell said in a speech before the National Association for Business Economics in Nashville, Tenn. His remarks come days ahead of the the crucial monthly jobs report. Powell said if the economy unfolds as expected, the Fed will cut interest rates "over time toward a more neutral stance." But it is in no rush, he made clear during a question-and-answer session following his speech. “This is not a committee that wants to cut rates quickly,” added Powell, referring to the Fed body that decides on the direction of rates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 7:00 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Chevron stock rises as FTC allows Hess deal Shares of Chevron rose close to 0.6% Monday afternoon following news that the US Federal Trade Commission cleared the company's $53 billion purchase of Hess Corp but barred CEO John Hess from serving on Chevron's board. Even after the FTC's order, a final obstacle to the deal is still present in Exxon Mobile's challenge to the deal, Reuters reported . The FTC alleged that Hess had openly communicated with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stabilize global oil markets. The FTC also said that allowing him to serve on Chevron's board "would amplify Mr. Hess's supportive messaging to OPEC and others, thereby meaningfully increasing the likelihood that Chevron would align its production with OPEC's output decisions to maintain higher prices." The deal by the No. 2 US oil company will give Chevron access to the oil-rich offshore fields of Guyana. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 6:33 PM GMT+1 Hamza Shaban Stocks trending in afternoon trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Monday: Stellantis ( STLA ): Shares of the automaker tumbled 14% Monday afternoon after the company issued a stark warning about its North American operations , dragging other auto stocks lower. Carnival ( CCL ): The cruise line fell 3% Monday after the company beat analyst expectations for the third quarter and raised its full-year guidance. But the results were still not enough to please investors looking for even stronger results. Meta ( META ): The social media company is still riding the optimism sparked by its developer conference last week, where it featured AI and mixed reality updates. Shares rose nearly 1% Monday following an analyst upgrade as Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co. upped its price target from $570 to $620 on the strength of Meta's showcase and future services. Boeing ( BA ): The airplane manufacturer sank deeper into its slump as the factory worker strike heads into its third week without a solution in sight and as talks with the company have broken off. Wall Street analysts have lowered their targets for Boeing stocks, citing costs associated with the strike. Shares fell more than 2% Monday. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 5:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Real estate leads S&P 500 higher The Real Estate ( XLRE ) sector rose more than 0.5% to lead the S&P 500 on Monday in a day with relatively subdued market action. The benchmark index itself was up just 0.06% around 12:30 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the Materials ( XLB ) sector was the biggest laggard falling 0.8%. Source: Yahoo Finance Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:45 PM GMT+1 Laura Bratton Nvidia stock slips on China sales fears Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock slipped around 1% in early trading after falling as much as 2.8% before the market open. The drop follows a report from Bloomberg Friday that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders — rather than Nvidia’s popular GPUs. Nvidia has designed special chips for China since the US ramped up export controls on semiconductors to the country beginning in late 2022. Nvidia currently exports a version of its Hopper chip called H20, which complies with tougher trade rules, to China. Nvidia is reportedly working to bring online a version of its latest Blackwell chips for China as well. Analysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Investors look for signs of growth in key economic data week A slew of labor market data headlined by the September jobs report will be in focus for investors this week. Updates on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors will also catch attention as market participants attempt to discern how quickly the US economy is slowing. Wall Street strategists argue there’s a clear read through on what type of data would be supportive of a further rally in stocks. Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance a scenario where the Fed isn't cutting because the economy needs it is "hugely bullish" for equities. Therefore a stronger than expected jobs report would likely be seen as a positive for stocks. The September jobs report is expected to show 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In August, the US economy added 142,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2%. "Everything is about the growth side of the economy and everything is about the consumer," Kaiser said. "Any data that suggests consumer spending is holding in and you're not seeing the weakness that people are worried about and that the Fed is worried about, I think that's all going to be positive for equity markets." Subsequently, a bad jobs report on Friday could have the opposite impact on stocks. "If it turns out that they started cutting because they're legitimately concerned about weakness in the labor market, rate cuts aren't going to be enough to help equities in that case and you're going to trade lower," Kaiser said. "So the why [the Fed is cutting] matters here. And payrolls is going to help answer that." Mon, September 30, 2024 at 3:15 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Automakers slide as Stellantis cuts 2024 profit outlook Stellantis ( STLA ) stock sank nearly 13% as the automaker cut its 2024 profit forecast. Instead of positive cash flow for the year, Stellantis now expects negative cash flow in a range of $5.58 billion to $11.17 billion. The automaker said it also expects its adjusted operating profit margin to come in between 5.5% and 7% this year, lower than the double-digit margins Stellantis initially forecast. “Deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period, while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply, as well as increased Chinese competition,” Stellantis said in a release. Ford ( F ) and GM ( GM ) also traded lower after the news. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 2:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Stocks slide at the open, all eyes on Powell US stocks moved lower on Monday but were still set for strong monthly and quarterly gains as investors waited to hear Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak in the run-up to the crucial monthly jobs report. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) all fell about 0.2%. With few catalysts to kick off the week, Powell’s speech on Monday afternoon is expected to be key. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 1:50 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer DirecTV to buy Dish Network Another media acquisition has been confirmed. Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal reports: Satellite TV provider DirecTV ( T , TPG ) said Monday it will buy rival Dish Network ( SATS ), including Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, through a debt exchange transaction. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is set to create one of the US's largest pay-TV providers. "The combination of DirecTV and Dish will benefit US video consumers by creating a more robust competitive force in a video industry dominated by streaming services owned by large tech companies and programmers," the companies said in a joint statement. Shares in EchoStar ( SATS ), which owns Dish Network, moved about 1% higher in premarket trading following the news. The stock had surged nearly 10% on Friday after the acquisition rumors intensified.

The benchmark index itself was up just 0.06% around 12:30 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the Materials ( XLB ) sector was the biggest laggard falling 0.8%.

The drop follows a report from Bloomberg Friday that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders — rather than Nvidia’s popular GPUs. Nvidia has designed special chips for China since the US ramped up export controls on semiconductors to the country beginning in late 2022. Nvidia currently exports a version of its Hopper chip called H20, which complies with tougher trade rules, to China. Nvidia is reportedly working to bring online a version of its latest Blackwell chips for China as well. Analysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 4:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Investors look for signs of growth in key economic data week A slew of labor market data headlined by the September jobs report will be in focus for investors this week. Updates on activity in the services and manufacturing sectors will also catch attention as market participants attempt to discern how quickly the US economy is slowing. Wall Street strategists argue there’s a clear read through on what type of data would be supportive of a further rally in stocks. Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance a scenario where the Fed isn't cutting because the economy needs it is "hugely bullish" for equities. Therefore a stronger than expected jobs report would likely be seen as a positive for stocks. The September jobs report is expected to show 130,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.2%, according to data from Bloomberg. In August, the US economy added 142,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2%. "Everything is about the growth side of the economy and everything is about the consumer," Kaiser said. "Any data that suggests consumer spending is holding in and you're not seeing the weakness that people are worried about and that the Fed is worried about, I think that's all going to be positive for equity markets." Subsequently, a bad jobs report on Friday could have the opposite impact on stocks. "If it turns out that they started cutting because they're legitimately concerned about weakness in the labor market, rate cuts aren't going to be enough to help equities in that case and you're going to trade lower," Kaiser said. "So the why [the Fed is cutting] matters here. And payrolls is going to help answer that." Mon, September 30, 2024 at 3:15 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Automakers slide as Stellantis cuts 2024 profit outlook Stellantis ( STLA ) stock sank nearly 13% as the automaker cut its 2024 profit forecast. Instead of positive cash flow for the year, Stellantis now expects negative cash flow in a range of $5.58 billion to $11.17 billion. The automaker said it also expects its adjusted operating profit margin to come in between 5.5% and 7% this year, lower than the double-digit margins Stellantis initially forecast. “Deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period, while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply, as well as increased Chinese competition,” Stellantis said in a release. Ford ( F ) and GM ( GM ) also traded lower after the news. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 2:35 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Stocks slide at the open, all eyes on Powell US stocks moved lower on Monday but were still set for strong monthly and quarterly gains as investors waited to hear Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak in the run-up to the crucial monthly jobs report. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), the Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) all fell about 0.2%. With few catalysts to kick off the week, Powell’s speech on Monday afternoon is expected to be key. Mon, September 30, 2024 at 1:50 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer DirecTV to buy Dish Network Another media acquisition has been confirmed. Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal reports: Satellite TV provider DirecTV ( T , TPG ) said Monday it will buy rival Dish Network ( SATS ), including Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, through a debt exchange transaction. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is set to create one of the US's largest pay-TV providers. "The combination of DirecTV and Dish will benefit US video consumers by creating a more robust competitive force in a video industry dominated by streaming services owned by large tech companies and programmers," the companies said in a joint statement. Shares in EchoStar ( SATS ), which owns Dish Network, moved about 1% higher in premarket trading following the news. The stock had surged nearly 10% on Friday after the acquisition rumors intensified.

Are Investors Undervaluing Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) By 42%? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 5:09 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Performance Food Group fair value estimate is US$135 Performance Food Group's US$78.21 share price signals that it might be 42% undervalued The US$87.40 analyst price target for PFGC is 35% less than our estimate of fair value Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Performance Food Group Company ( NYSE:PFGC ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Performance Food Group The Model We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$834.6m US$934.3m US$897.0m US$880.2m US$875.2m US$878.3m US$887.1m US$899.9m US$915.8m US$934.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ -1.88% Est @ -0.56% Est @ 0.36% Est @ 1.00% Est @ 1.45% Est @ 1.76% Est @ 1.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$786 US$830 US$750 US$694 US$650 US$615 US$585 US$559 US$536 US$515 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%. Story continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$934m× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.5%) = US$26b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$26b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%) 10 = US$15b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$21b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$78.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf Important Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Performance Food Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.880. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Performance Food Group Strength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Consumer Retailing industry. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Next Steps: Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Performance Food Group, there are three fundamental factors you should explore: Risks : Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Maneet Ahuja Forbes Staff Editor-at-Large at Forbes covering billionaires and beyond Sep 30, 2024, 06:30am EDT Updated Oct 1, 2024, 07:43am EDT On Wall Street, risk-free investments are the Holy Grail, so no price is too high to pay for an NFL team. Now a new wave of private equity owners are entering the game with mountains of cash–and nothing to lose. By Maneet Ahuja and Hank Tucker , Forbes Staff A s 63,000 diehard fans pour into Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, for the Buccaneers’ season opener against the Washington Commanders, billionaire Josh Harris, Washington’s new controlling owner, is feeling the heat. It is 90 degrees on this early September afternoon, and sweat is seeping through his maroon polo. He paces the field peri­meter with security in tow, beaming as he shakes hands, poses for pictures and signs hats for Commanders supporters praying for a winning season (the team’s last one was in 2016). Harris hears an eager fan shouting his name. His T-shirt reads: “We almost always almost win.” A humorously defeatist attitude befitting the last 30 years of Washington football. “They went through a lot, and they’ve been there a long time waiting for this,” says the 59-year-old Harris. “Having grown up [near D.C.], it’s very personal for me. Obviously, you have to deliver, right? I stay up at night thinking about that.” As the Harris era begins, there’s a lot at stake. The $6 billion he paid for the Commanders last year—besting interest from the likes of Jeff Bezos and Tilman Fertitta—en­ded Daniel Snyder’s scandal-plagued tenure and set a record for the sale of an NFL team. To get the deal done, Harris assembled a 23-person ownership group that included David Blitzer—a top exec at Blackstone and Harris’ partner in his other sports endeavors through Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment—as well as NBA legend Magic Johnson and billionaires Mitch Rales (Danaher Corp.) and Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO. Harris didn’t make any rash changes after the deal closed in July 2023, but after a disappointing 4-13 season, he cleaned house, bringing in a new head coach, general manager and quarterback, Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels, the second pick in this spring’s draft. Cody Pickens for Forbes For a kid who grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, whose parents spent 25 years on the waiting list for season tickets to see the then-Washington Redskins play at historic RFK Stadium, it’s a dream come true. It also fits nicely into the private equity titan’s sports portfolio, which includes the Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, English soccer club Crystal Palace and Nascar team Joe Gibbs Racing. Soon Harris is likely to be joined in the exclusive NFL owners’ club by more of his buyout-fund brethren. Last month the NFL became the last major professional league to open its doors to private equity firms, with owners voting 31-1—Cincinnati’s Brown family was the only dissent—to allow a select group of approved firms to buy up to 10% of each team, subject to several other restrictions, such as a minimum holding period of six years. It’s a watershed moment for a league that has seen team values skyrocket into the multibillion-dollar range, severely limiting the pool of potential buyers. Even Harris, worth an estimated $9.3 billion, worried that owning a professional football team would soon be out of reach. When hedge fund heavyweight David Tepper bought the Carolina Panthers in 2018 for $2.3 billion, it was the most anyone had ever paid for an NFL franchise. No other team came up for sale until 2022, when Pat Bowlen’s heirs put the Denver Broncos on the market. Harris put together a group to make an offer, but a group led by the Walton family outbid him to pay a staggering $4.7 billion, doubling Tepper’s record. “The way the NFL was heading, forget about The Forbes 400,” Harris says. “You had to be in The Forbes 50.” Inviting Wall Street to the NFL party is a game changer. The eight private equity funds approved by the NFL to invest, including Blackstone, Carlyle, Arctos and Ares Management, currently have dry powder in excess of $160 billion. That’s a lot of firepower. It will ensure that franchise values, which by Forbes’ reckoning have appreciated more than 60% in the last three years, continue to rise. In fact, barely two weeks after the ink was dry on the NFL’s ownership rule change, Arctos was in talks with Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins, to buy a stake in his team that would value it north of $7 billion. For private equity firms like Arctos, it’s a no-brainer. NFL teams are underleveraged, yet they rake in so much from media rights deals it’s almost impossible not to turn a profit whether they win or lose. Since 2000, NFL teams have significantly outperformed nearly every other asset, including stocks, real estate, bonds—and, yes, private equity funds . If you adjust for risk, the numbers look even better. “In business you’re graded by Ebitda and stock price and cash flow,” Harris says. “In sports you’re graded by creating positive memories.” J oshua Harris, the eldest son of an orthodontist who was a collegiate rower at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1950s, is a lifelong sports devotee. Growing up in Maryland, he played Little League, basketball and soccer. When he was 9, he found his true love, wrestling, after winning a tournament at summer camp. He would go on to compete competitively all the way through high school at the Field School in D.C. and in college at Penn, representing the Quakers at 118 pounds. After excelling in economics his freshman year, he transferred to the Wharton School and, like many of the college’s Reagan-era graduates, made his way to Wall Street. He landed at Drexel Burnham Lambert during the peak of Michael Milken’s junk bond-fueled profitability. He worked for two years in mergers at the firm’s New York office under the tutelage of Milken’s right-hand man, Leon Black. During Harris’ short stint at Drexel, the firm was making headlines for its involvement in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, and Milken’s operation came under investigation by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney’s office. Harris left in 1988 to pursue an MBA from Harvard and in 1990 accepted a job at Blackstone. Just two months later, however, he quit to join Leon Black and Marc Rowan, both refugees from Drexel’s collapse, to start Apollo Advisors. The trio spent the next 30 years building Apollo into one of the world’s largest private equity firms, now managing $700 billion in assets. Harris was known to be demanding and obsessive about details. His most notable deal was acquiring Dutch chemical maker LyondellBasell in 2008, using $2 billion of its distressed bank debt. After managing it through a prolonged bankruptcy and a 2010 IPO, Harris and partners wound up netting a $10 billion profit by the time they fully cashed out in 2013. Black became tainted by his close ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, whom he paid $158 million for tax and estate planning services, and when Black stepped down under pressure in 2021, Apollo’s board picked Rowan, not Harris, to succeed him as CEO. While Josh Harris can thank private equity for his initial billions, sports are making him richer faster. cody Pickens for forbes Harris quit later that year but didn’t stay away from private equity for long. He launched 26North in 2022 and has already built it to $23 billion in assets, announcing its first buyout—of ArchKey, a Missouri-based electrical contractor for commercial buildings—in September for more than $1 billion. “The ability to generate alpha was harder with over half a trillion or a trillion dollars, so I wanted to go back to basics,” he says. “I wanted to go back to what I had done when Apollo was much smaller.” T he rise of any asset class is often easy to understand in hindsight, but when Harris first became interested in sports ownership after Apollo’s 2011 IPO gave the billionaire newfound liquidity, it was far from a sure thing that franchise values would continue to go up. The NBA was having a particularly difficult year, dealing with a dispute with its players’ union over revenue sharing that came to a head in a five-month lockout, shortening the 2011-12 season. “This was post-Michael Jordan, and people were saying maybe the best years of this league were behind us. Certainly, we didn’t believe that, but that’s what a lot of people in the market were saying,” says NBA commissioner Adam Silver, then the league’s deputy commissioner under David Stern. “Josh took a long-term view, and he was very analytical in his approach. He did as thorough a due diligence process with the league as any owner had done in my time in the league up till then, and I got here in 1992.” BILLIONAIRES’ PLAYGROUND NFL teams have grown in value much faster and more regularly than stocks or real estate, and they’ve even beaten private equity since the turn of the century, helping wealthy owners get even richer. The Philadelphia 76ers won their last championship in 1983, in the spring of Harris’ freshman year at Penn. He recalls marveling at how the team united and delighted the city. But ever since, the franchise had been stuck in a cycle of irrelevance. It was losing $25 million a year and attendance was sagging. Harris felt that the team’s owner, cable TV giant Comcast, was more passionate about the Flyers, the city’s hockey team, than basketball, and was open to making a deal. Harris and Blitzer, the Blackstone banker whom Harris had befriended while working in London during the fin­ancial crisis, pulled a page from their day jobs to orchestrate a corporate carve-out for $280 million to acquire the team with a group of investors made up of mostly Penn alumni and Philadelphia natives who remembered the Sixers’ 1980s heyday. “I remember David Stern saying, ‘You don’t realize how good a deal you’re getting’—as he insisted we pay more in revenue share,” Harris says. After acquiring the team, Harris decided the way out of mediocrity was to first get worse. He oversaw the rebuil­ding phase in which the team traded veterans for future draft picks and earned its own high draft picks with poor play on the court. The dark period coined a forlorn rallying cry that fans would chant at games: “Trust the Process.” Unfortunately, it took longer than Harris envisioned, with five straight losing seasons from 2012 to 2017. But it eventually worked. Philly has made the playoffs in each of the last seven years and fans have come back in droves, selling out every game since 2017. “The Sixers are a top-quartile franchise in the NBA. Philly cares about sports. They’re tough and they’re demanding,” Harris says. “And Washington is a top-quartile franchise in the NFL. If you just do the right thing, you know you’re going to make money in those franchises.” That’s why the cost of admission to the NFL didn’t dissuade him. The league makes around $10 billion per year from its media rights deals, a number Harris expects to rise significantly when it renegotiates its contracts following the 2028-29 season. According to Nielsen, 93 of the 100 most-watched TV shows of 2023 were NFL games—and three of the other seven were college football games. An average of 17.9 million people watched run-of-the-mill regular season games last year, while a record 120 million tuned in for Super Bowl LVIII. Compare that to nationally televised NBA games garnering 1.6 million eyeballs on average. The NBA still inked an 11-year, $76 billion TV deal in July that will take the league through 2036. “The NBA media deal per viewer hour is now multiples of the NFL deal,” Harris says. “It does feel like there’s upward pressure on the NFL media deal.” More than half of NFL team controlling owners are over age 70. A major intergenerational wealth transfer is looming. It’s not as if NFL owners have to pinch pennies until the media rights are up for renewal. The NFL pools its TV revenue, plus sales from leaguewide sponsorships and merchandising. That money is distributed equally to its 32 teams. Each team also contributes 34% of its ticket sales to the general pool. That helps smaller-market franchises stay competitive. Last year, each NFL outfit received $400 million from the league, covering around two-thirds of annual revenue for a typical team. It’s a type of corporate socialism that guarantees every team will make heaps of money. According to Forbes’ estimates, every NFL team netted at least $50 million in operating income last year, and most exceeded $100 million. Whether you win the Super Bowl or are stuck in last place hardly matters. The Caro­lina Panthers have had an abysmal record on the field since Tepper bought them in 2018. But the team has still doubled in value, with an estimated $109 million in operating income last year. Harris’ Commanders were the worst in their division in 2023 but had strong 26% operating margins, making an estimated $160 million on $609 million in revenue, net of stadium debt service. “If there’s a recession, your chemical company, your steel company, the stuff I used to do, they’ll be hit,” Harris says. “In the NFL, to a large extent, 70% of the revenues are contracted, and then you have the 30% that might be hit a little, but it’s very non-correlated.” Profits are not as much of a sure thing in the National Hockey League, but that hasn’t stopped valuations from rising. Harris’ New Jersey Devils are worth $1.45 billion, 4.5 times more than his $320 million 2013 purchase price. Things are even better for NBA owners. Forbes now values the 76ers at $4.3 billion, 15 times what Harris’ group paid for them. H arris isn’t just sitting back

When George Coulam decided to retire, he had a problem. He owned the Texas Renaissance Festival — which bills itself as the largest such gathering in America, drawing over 500,000 annual visitors — and he needed to find a successor. Several longtime associates were eager to take over, but Coulam had run the fair for decades; he wanted his pride and joy to land in the right hands. Suitor after suitor put in bids to buy the business, but none felt like the right fit. Across the US, older business owners are arriving at the same juncture. Over half of small businesses — those with a single owner and fewer than 500 employees — are owned by people over 50. The wealth-management firm NewEdge Wealth has estimated that boomer-owned businesses in the US are worth about $10 trillion. Those boomers can't retire and enjoy their sunset years until they figure out what to do with their businesses . Can a relative or longtime employee take over? Should they shut down? Or can they sell? For millennials with the entrepreneurial bug, this boomer retirement bomb could be a boon. As they enter their prime wealth-building years, many are anxious about how they'll save up for retirement ; in a turbulent housing market , buying an existing business offers a tantalizing opportunity. The market-research firm Forrester found in a survey it conducted last year that 64% of people buying businesses were millennials or younger. Sure, many small businesses aren't glamorous — think dental practices or accounting firms — and they involve long hours and unpredictable market forces. But they might just be a better pathway to retirement than building a business from scratch. Advertisement Private-equity firms have long seen the wisdom in acquiring small businesses. Why should they be the only ones reaping the fruits of boomer labor? In the late 1990s, Nancy Forster-Holt, an accountant at Ernst & Young, was transferred from Sacramento, California, to Maine. She fell in love with the state and her now-husband, Steve Holt. They decided to buy a business together. Since she had experience as a chief financial officer and he was an engineer, they focused on manufacturing companies. They soon found Shaw & Tenney, a century-and-a-half-old manufacturer of wooden paddles and oars in Orono. Before the Holts bought it in 2003, Shaw & Tenney had had only two other owners: the Tenney family, which operated it until 1978, and Paul and Helen Reagan. When they decided to retire two years ago, the Holts thought their children might want to take over. But no one showed any interest. "They all grew up in it and worked in it," Forster-Holt, who's also a clinical associate professor at the University of Rhode Island's business school, told me. "Our last one graduated in 2022, and he's a food scientist, and we're a manufacturer of oars and paddles." The couple realized they had to sell, and they started marketing the company while planning the graduation party. That's when Jennifer and Neil Gutekunst came along. When they acquired Shaw & Tenney in 2023, they had two other small businesses under their belt. They took what the Holts built — a recognized brand, equipment, a highly skilled workforce, and customer relationships — and ran with it. Advertisement "The businesses we purchased all had cash day one," Neil Gutekunst said. Neither of the Gutekunsts had a sales background, but the three companies they purchased had strong customer bases and solid reputations. All they had to do was keep things running. The US Small Business Administration said in July that there were nearly 35 million small businesses in the US. The vast majority of those, 82%, had no employees other than the owner, meaning they probably wouldn't make sense to sell. But each year, about 65,000 of the remaining chunk of businesses are listed on BizBuySell, an online listing service of businesses for sale. Related stories Edie Ellis, who runs a consulting firm in Chicago and has advised industrial companies on acquisitions, said the peak of small-business sales began when baby boomers started to turn 60, in about 2006. Many owners found that their children didn't want to take over, so they looked for buyers. The kids of small-business owners "run the opposite direction, because they saw the lifestyle," Ellis said. "They saw that mom and dad worked 24/7, they didn't have a weekend off, you know? They don't want to do that." Data from BizBuySell indicates that sales of small businesses have been lower since the 2006 peak and dipped during the pandemic, but quarterly transaction volume has largely recovered from 2020 and has held steady. In the second quarter of this year, BizBuySell had listings for over 35,000 businesses with a median asking price of $395,000 and a median revenue of over $700,000 — meanwhile, in the housing market, the median home price recently hit $412,000. Demand for these businesses is growing, pushing the median sales price up 25% over last year. While not all of these companies will be a good investment, the right venture could offer an edge over more traditional wealth-building routes. The upside of buying an existing small business, besides inheriting foundational elements — a brand, suppliers, systems, and customers — is that financing an acquisition is often easier than financing a brand-new business. You don't need to have hundreds of thousands in cash on hand to take advantage. In some cases, sellers are willing to assist in financing because they want the business out of their hands. Some will accept deferred compensation or a share of future earnings as a way to lessen the up-front cost. Buyers with good credit can also borrow money through the Small Business Administration. Advertisement Existing companies often have assets that can help make financing easier. If the business owns land, buildings, or equipment, that can serve as collateral for a bank loan. Plus, with revenue already coming in the door, lenders know they won't have to wait to receive payment. You come to work and you've got your to-do list, and a truck has hit your building, and now your day is something completely different. Do you have the temperament for that? Of course, there are some logistical challenges in finding the right business — fewer than a quarter of the businesses listed on BizBuySell sell in a given year. For one thing, great small businesses aren't always in places where people want to move. Dave Specht, the director of the Drucker School Global Family Business Institute at Claremont Graduate University, told me that the situation is compounded when people in small towns don't want to talk to their neighbors about their plans for their businesses. "There's great secrecy around the timing of transitions and things like that," Specht, who lives in a small town in Washington, said. Often, potential buyers end up looking elsewhere. "They go to a larger town or a larger city because they just don't know." Some businesses need a buyer with a combination of skills that isn't easy to find. Some have real estate that's worth more than the rest of the assets. And some are "lifestyle companies," such as bookstores, yarn stores, and other Main Street businesses, that don't generate much profit beyond the owner's small salary. Other businesses might have hidden problems, Ellis told me. "Have they been paying their bills? Have they been paying the IRS? You don't know what you don't know," she said. Advertisement The challenges don't stop once you've made the purchase. Fewer than two-thirds of small businesses in the US in 2022 were profitable, and over a million businesses of all sizes close each year. "You get people that come up from Wall Street and they want to buy a bed-and-breakfast in Maine because they've always loved Maine," Forster-Holt said. "But guess what? They're working 24/7, 365, helping other people enjoy Maine." She's noticed that people with experience working in corporations sometimes struggle with the flat hierarchy and ever-changing priorities of a small business. "You come to work and you've got your to-do list, and a truck has hit your building, and now your day is something completely different," she said. "Do you have the temperament for that?" Related stories The Holts found that they did. "I loved working there," Forster-Holt told me. And those who can roll with a little bit of upheaval can reap the financial upsides. Private-equity firms are certainly familiar with those upsides. The American Investment Council reported that 85% of private-equity investments in 2022 were small businesses. Citing the data provider Preqin, PwC recently reported that, as of the end of May, private equity firms had $1 trillion in liquid assets that were looking for investments. These companies are interested in small businesses that operate similarly in many markets and can be rolled up together, such as plumbing or HVAC companies. Advertisement "Private equity is smart in targeting family businesses," Specht told me. "Many of them are great businesses." Fortunately for millennial buyers, many family owners would prefer not to deal with Wall Street. In 2022, Dinkel's Bakery, a beloved Chicago institution, closed after a century in business. Norm Dinkel, the third-generation owner, wanted to retire, and he couldn't find a buyer who also wanted to operate the business. Anyone fortunate enough to have had a Dinkel's chocolate doughnut or fresh strawberry paczki knows the loss. Traditionally, small businesses were family businesses, and the eldest male child was expected to take it over when the patriarch was ready to step down. That got Dinkel's through a hundred years of operation. Many small-business owners want to keep the company in the family, said Brian Brogan, who works as a wealth advisor to family-business owners and teaches in the family-business program at Saint Joseph's University in Pennsylvania. If that isn't an option, they look for someone they can trust to carry on the business. Even if you can't plan on receiving an inheritance, you can create one for yourself (and your own children). Coulam, the owner of the Texas Renaissance Festival, is slightly older than the average boomer business owner — he's entering his late 80s. But even he hasn't found a suitable buyer. His succession search, which was documented in the recent HBO series "Ren Faire," highlights the difficulty of passing along a business someone spent their whole life building. With small businesses especially, it's not just about the numbers — it's a very personal decision. Advertisement Still, for buyers able to find the right match, snatching up an existing business could be a smart move. For the Gutekunsts, one acquisition intended as a lifestyle change has turned into a collection of businesses built around southern Maine's deep tradition of woodcrafting. "It's fun," Jennifer Gutekunst tells me. It also beats not having a satisfying retirement plan. Last year I wrote about the myth of the "Great Boomer Wealth Transfer " — about how most boomers don't have many assets to pass along, and those that do are likely to get eaten up by the high cost of elder care. But even if you can't plan on receiving an inheritance, you can create one for yourself (and your own children). Buying up small businesses allows people without wealthy boomer parents to cash in on the trillions of dollars of wealth the generation is sitting on. Ann C.

Advertisement DirecTV knows it needs leverage to survive in a cutthroat TV industry marred by cord-cutting, so it's joining forces with one of its biggest rivals . Two decades of flirting between DirecTV and Dish Network culminated in a long-rumored deal unveiled on Monday. DirecTV will absorb $9.8 billion worth of Dish's debt, and private-equity firm TPG will own all of the satellite-TV giant after buying AT&T's stake in a separate move. The timing of this tie-up between the two major satellite-TV providers is no coincidence. DirecTV is fresh off a hostile carriage dispute with Disney in which its customers went without channels like ESPN and ABC for nearly two weeks at the start of football season, which is a huge driver of pay-TV sign-ups. The companies eventually reached a truce in which each seemed to secure concessions, though it won't be clear who won until details are finalized. Advertisement Like all pay-TV providers, DirecTV has been crushed by cord-cutting for the last decade or more. The satellite titan hopes to stem the tide by offering skinnier, genre-based bundles and streaming services at no extra cost , though industry observers doubt those moves can reverse declines . But unlike Charter and Comcast, which have broadband businesses they can fall back on, DirecTV has no clear backup plan outside the pay-TV bundle. Related stories With this in mind, media companies may try to push around DirecTV. That's one reason the TV provider negotiated so aggressively with Disney and even went on offense by teaming up with rival Dish. The move might not be a home run, but it could help DirecTV at least avoid a strikeout. "I don't know that it's a game-changer," Corey Martin, chair of entertainment law firm Granderson Des Rochers's Entertainment Finance Practice, said of the deal in an interview with BI. "I think it allows them to continue to have a seat at the table for the foreseeable future." Advertisement DirecTV may need to fight to survive DirecTV has a survival plan: It wants to become the ultimate middleman between content providers and consumers. It hopes to endure by putting traditional TV channels and streaming services in one place and establishing itself as the central interface, similar, in some respects, to how Spotify pools together music from major labels. It's also similar to the pitch made by TV operating system heavyweights like Roku and Amazon. "We need some aggregator in the space who can bring all of your content together that you actually want to watch, not based on the studio that creates it," Jon Greer, the head of communications for DirecTV, told Business Insider. While streaming has given consumers tons of entertainment options, it has also created headaches. There's so much content that it can be tough to find quality shows and movies, and the fragmented landscape can be difficult to navigate. Sports fans have it particularly hard, especially since the launch of sports streaming service Venu was blocked in late August. DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow said to investors and analysts in a webinar on Monday that while customers love watching shows on demand and on the platform of their choice, "they are pained with the idea of how the pricing works, how to account-manage across multiple subscriptions, about where to find their content and navigate each individual portal differently." Advertisement These issues, plus streamers' steadily rising prices, have helped bundles mount a comeback . And early evidence suggests that offerings like the Max-Hulu-Disney+ bundle are popular . DirecTV's fantasy is that consumers get fed up with paying for a litany of services and turn to them for a one-stop solution. Implicit in the satellite provider's strategy is the assumption that media companies need their help to build highly profitable direct-to-consumer businesses. "This will again allow us to work with the programmers in a way that isn't so much about bullying," Morrow said. "This is about collaboration." Advertisement But there's a space between bullying and collaboration, which is where the relationship between TV distributors and programmers usually stands. In that context, DirecTV's tie-up with Dish could give it the leverage it needs to try to turn its future vision into reality. "The programmer relationship is pretty lopsided where they know their market power, they exercise their market power," Greer said. "We never want to do that, but we need to be able to have the scale to be able to have these different conversations with programmers."

CAA Sues Range Media Partners For "Unlawful" Stealing of Confidential Material Skip to main content By Dominic Patten Dominic Patten Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics @DeadlineDominic More Stories By Dominic This Week On The Campaign Trail: Kamala Harris And Donald Trump Do Separate Fox News Appearances Sean “Diddy” Combs Faces Claims Of Raping 13-Year-Old Girl In 2000 With Unnamed “Male & Female Celebrity” In Latest Round Of Lawsuits Alec Baldwin Returns To ‘SNL’ As Bret Baier In Cold Open Spoofing Fox News-Kamala Harris Interview View All October 1, 2024 1:40pm 19 Comments Services to share this page.

Now the Bryan Lourd -led CAA is after Range in open court for alleged theft and some big bucks. “Range is an unlicensed talent agency built on deceit,” reads the four-claim lawsuit filed September 30 in Los Angeles Superior Court. Related Stories News Prolific ‘La La Land’ Producer Automatik Merges With Range Media Partners Agencies Francois-Henri Pinault’s Artémis Closes Deal For Majority Stake In CAA – Update “Seeking a shortcut to success, Range’s initial founder, Peter Micelli (a former CAA literary agent and CAA member) found four highly paid CAA leaders to act as his accomplices: posing as loyal CAA members, sitting shoulder to shoulder in confidential CAA meetings about clients and business, all the while covertly working to benefit Range and themselves, and to harm CAA,” adds the suit, which seeks large but unspecified damages. Click to read CAA’s four-claim lawsuit. Watch on Deadline “Put simply, Range’s business model is the pursuit of unlawful profit through deception: Range skirts rules that California legislators and artists’ guilds put in place to protect those working in the entertainment industry,” the filing adds. “The core ‘trick’ of Range is that it acts as a talent agency, but labels itself a management company. Range therefore engages in lucrative transactions foreclosed to law-abiding talent agencies,” aka agencies like CAA. If the agency’s attorney’s words in the 28-page filing weren’t clear enough, the lawyers doubled down outside the docket. “CAA is prepared to prove that Range Media was formed through dishonest conduct and, as reflected in other public, pending legal proceedings about Range’s failure to comply with arbitration subpoenas, has concealed evidence of its founders’ actions,” CAA counsel Elena Baca told Deadline today of the suit filed Monday. “Peter Micelli, along with his accomplices who were at CAA while founding Range, conducted a lengthy scheme to enrich themselves in ways that violated their contracts and legal obligations to CAA, talent guild regulations, and ethical boundaries, as CAA will demonstrate in court,” the Paul Hastings LLP attorney added. “CAA will fiercely protect the agency against improper market conduct and the misuse of its confidential information.” Reps for Range, which was created by David Bugliari, Micelli and Jack Whigham, did not respond to request for comment from Deadline. If and when they do, this post will be updated. In point of fact, none of this is unexpected. A number of the accusations in the complaint have come up in the arbitration proceedings, I hear. Actually, in search of a timeline and more, CAA has stepped out of that process in part to seek greater access to documents involving Range moneyman (and New York Mets boss) Steven Cohen and former clients that jumped ship when the self-declared management company was unveiled four years ago. CAA is also seeking to force testimony from Micelli and other core members Range team in the behind-closed-doors arbitration. To that, the lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference may serve as a wedge to strongly nudge a reaction in arbitration. As this has all been going in court, Range has been pulling in investments over the last few months from John Malone’s Liberty Global and TPG founding partner David Bonderman’s family office Wildcat Capital Management as the company expands its reach and scope domestically and overseas. Over the past year and a half alone, Range has bolstered its film division by merging with La La Land production company Automatik. The company has also rolled out a sports strategy calling for the acquisition of growth-stage companies within the media rights, athlete marketing and golf verticals; and fortified its music efforts by launching a music publishing division and opening a Nashville office. Not that CAA has been standing still. This new suit comes almost a year to the day after Artemis, run by French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault (spouse of CAA client Salma Hayek), closed the deal on its estimated $7 billon purchase of a majority share of the agency. Singapore-based Temasek remains a minority investor in CAA, while CMC Capital remains a strategic partner. All added up, those big bucks and big backers are intended to give CAA the booster rockets to scale up in Hollywood and beyond as the media industry pivots into uncharted territories.

Support Vox Member Exclusive Policy / Health Care The profit-obsessed monster destroying American emergency rooms Private equity decimated emergency care in the United States — without you even noticing. by Keren Landman, MD Oct 3, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC Facebook Link Xinmei Liu for Vox Keren Landman, MD is a senior reporter covering public health, emerging infectious diseases, the health workforce, and health justice at Vox. Keren is trained as a physician, researcher, and epidemiologist and has served as a disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Facebook Link John didn’t start his career mad. He trained as an emergency medicine doctor in a tidily run Midwestern emergency room about a decade ago. He loved the place, especially the way its management was so responsive to the doctors’ needs, offering extra staffing when things got busy and paid administrative time for teaching other trainees. Doctors provided most of the care, occasionally overseeing the work of nurse practitioners and physician associates . He signed on to start there full-time shortly after finishing his residency. A month before his start date, a private equity firm bought the practice. “I can’t even tell you how quickly it changed,” John says. The ratio of doctors to other clinicians flipped, shrinking doctor hours to a minimum as the firm moved to save on salaries. John — who is being referred to by a pseudonym due to concerns over professional repercussions — quit and found a job at another emergency room in a different state. It too soon sold out to the same private equity firm. Then it happened again, and then again. Small emergency rooms “kept getting gobbled up by these gigantic corporations so fast,” he said. By the time doctors tried to jump ship to another ER, “they were already sold out.” At all of the private equity-acquired ERs where John worked, things changed almost overnight: In addition to having their hours cut, doctors were docked pay if they didn’t evaluate new arrivals within 25 minutes of them walking through the door, leading to hasty orders for “kitchen sink” workups geared mostly toward productivity — not toward real cost-effectiveness or diagnostic precision. Amid all of this, cuts to their hours when ER volumes were low meant John and his colleagues’ pay was all over the place. Patient care was suffering “from the toe sprains all the way up to the gunshot wounds and heart attacks,” says John. His experience wasn’t an anomaly — it was happening in emergency rooms across the country. “All of my colleagues were experiencing the same thing.” “Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” At times, the short staffing combined with the pressure to churn patients led to deadly shortcuts. John remembers rushing to evaluate one patient and missing his extensive history of alcohol abuse. The patient spent hours getting tests directed at the wrong diagnosis. John could have put together a more appropriate plan if he’d had a few more minutes to sit down and get a better history, but by the time he realized what was going on, the patient was too severely ill. He died in the intensive care unit two days later. “Is that 100 percent because of that staffing? Probably not,” says John. “But if I wasn’t so stressed about jumping into that patient room, making sure my door-to-provider time was less than 25 minutes …” The hypothetical hangs in the air. “Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” Xinmei Liu for Vox The story of how private equity has been able to so thoroughly debilitate emergency care is one of the more dramatic examples of how corporate interests are corrosive to America’s health care system — and how powerless they leave individual consumers. Today, private equity continues to operate a shocking quarter of ERs nationwide , as of March 2024. Still, there’s some hope: Academics, patient advocates, and doctors say you can make defensive moves to protect your finances and care before, during, and after you or a loved one visits an ER. Understanding private equity’s transformation of America’s emergency rooms is the first step. How private equity sunk its claws into emergency care Modern private equity got its start in the early 1980s, when a free-market acolyte — and former member of the Nixon administration — completed the first major “ leveraged buyout .” Using mostly borrowed money, William Simon and his partner bought a greeting card company, extracted huge fees , and then sold it for a massive profit less than two years later. Over the next few decades, what was then called the leveraged buyout industry moved into other sectors. Firms flipped businesses to yield spectacular profits, often cutting corners on the products and services they offered, eliminating jobs, and reducing employee benefits. It was only a matter of time until the industry, now rebranded as private equity, turned its gaze on the US’s $4 trillion health care sector, which was already becoming increasingly commercialized as nonprofit health systems consolidated, paid their executives ever more extravagant salaries , and otherwise played business hardball. Private equity takeovers in health care started around 2000 and have steadily increased since; when several big banks crumbled in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity’s growth only accelerated. Emergency medicine wasn’t always an appealing target for private equity. Physician staffing in many emergency rooms around the country was traditionally handled by co-op-like groups, run by working doctors , that contracted with hospitals. In the 1990s, ex-physicians and businesspeople began taking ownership of these so-called contract management groups (CMGs). As they did, they started acting more like for-profit businesses, centralizing decision-making and earnings. The easier it was to make decisions that prioritized profits, the more money CMGs made — and the more attractive they became to private equity. Through the mid- to late-2010s , private equity firms swallowed up a shocking number of American emergency rooms, leaving in their wake a generationally hollowed-out system for providing emergency care to people across the country. Private equity firms and other corporate interests owned nearly 9 percent of ER doctor groups in 2009; by 2019, they owned 22 percent . The wave of takeovers and consolidations peaked in 2021 but carries on all over the US, especially in Florida, Texas, and other parts of the South and West where the firms have been most aggressive . Doctors trying to practice medicine the way they’d been trained to — with a priority on patient care, not profits — found they couldn’t outrun the monster. Private equity’s dominance persisted even after the federal No Surprises Act , enacted in 2022, made many of their most profitable practices illegal. Lots of for-profit models are a bad fit for health care, but of all of them, private equity is perhaps the worst, says Eileen O’Grady , director of programs at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group: “It basically takes the for-profit model and makes it so much more extractive and so much more harmful and risky.” Private equity puts profit above all else To understand what makes private equity such a malignant force in health care, you have to understand its uniquely craven and purposefully opaque corporate structure. Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you want it to make more money. You have a few options: You can plow all your profits back into the business until it grows — what business school types call organic growth. Alternatively, you can get a bank loan. If you’re really ambitious, you can sell shares of your lemonade stand to the general public by promising them a good return on their investment. There’s another option here, one that will make you richer quicker: You can sell all or most of the stand to the rich kid at the end of the street. He’s offering you a lot of money for it — more than you’d get over the short term from the other options. That’s because he’s taken out a huge loan to pay for the deal. But there are a couple of catches: First, if he runs into financial trouble (which he very well might, since he’s been buying up lemonade stands all over town), he’ll sell it off for parts, leaving the neighborhood lemonade-less. This will cost him nothing personally because he used the lemonade stand as collateral for that big loan. The second and perhaps more important catch is that this kid is buying your lemonade stand in order to sell it. He doesn’t care about lemonade or the people who like it. His strategy is to make the stand’s balance sheet look so attractive that a few years later, another investor will buy it at a premium — or if that fails, then yes, to sell it off for parts. A year down the road, odds are high your precious lemonade stand will be a sad shadow of what it once was, or it might not exist at all. That kid is private equity. Xinmei Liu for Vox When private equity comes for a lemonade stand (or for Toys “R” Us , Samsonite , Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams , or for any of the thousands of businesses these firms have taken over since they rose to prominence in the late 1980s), the result is often a sad story about the decline of a legacy brand — shoddy products and lost jobs. Depressing, but not a life-and-death issue. When private equity comes for health care, though, the result is human suffering: Elderly and intellectually disabled people sitting in puddles of their own waste , sick patients not getting the care they need , worse outcomes for patients . It’s not just lemonade. People’s lives are at stake. The way private equity gets into emergency care is by buying out the CMGs that manage physician staffing — that is to say, the firms only buy the clinicians themselves. It’s a different model than when private equity invests in other areas of health care. When firms buy hospitals, nursing homes, medical practices, rehabilitation facilities, and group homes, they acquire not only staff, but also buildings, land, and medical equipment. In the case of emergency care, “private equity doesn’t pay the hospital rent, they don’t hire the nurses, they don’t pay the electric bills, they don’t provide any of the equipment,” says Robert McNamara , chair of the emergency medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. The hospital still handles those finances. “They’re just working the labor force. … The highest-cost thing on their expense side is the board-certified emergency physician.” When emergency rooms first caught the eye of private equity firms, the prospective investors offered the physician owners of CMGs huge payouts. Leon Adelman , an emergency medicine doctor who leads the staffing firm Ivy Clinicians and writes a workforce-focused newsletter , says the owners faced a tough choice: “‘Do I do what is ethical and feels right … and I get a nice going-away party and maybe a watch or something — or do I get $10 million?’” “What they were buying was the ability to charge patients who were consuming a non-shoppable service,” Adelman says — one for which patients are unable to compare prices. If you’re having a heart attack, you’re not going to call around to hospitals to find out who is going to give you the best deal. Hospitals that increasingly have profit on the brain often found private equity a more attractive partner than doctor-owned CMGs. The firms are flush with cash, which means they don’t look to the hospitals to shore up their finances. “They won’t ask you for a penny,” Adelman explains. “They’re making plenty of money.” Once a private equity firm bought an emergency room, there were two levers it could pull to make a profit: It could maximize what it reaped from patients who’d received services, and it could cut what it spent paying the clinicians who provided those services. Doing both at the same time has made emergency medicine practically unrecognizable. Burned-out doctors, screwed-over patients Under new private equity ownership, ERs adopted an assortment of unsavory practices. Firms not only pressured clinicians to see patients faster, as illustrated by John’s experience, but to recommend hospital admission for more patients. They also dramatically raised the price tags for a range of emergency services, resulting in back-breakingly large bills for patients nationwide, like ones charging thousands of dollars for glue applied to a half-inch wound. To avoid having to negotiate those astronomical bills with the expert hagglers at insurance companies, firms kept their ERs from participating in many insurance networks. It was easier to collect on a so-called balance bill — the portion of a medical bill not paid for by a patient’s insurer — if the care a patient had received wasn’t covered by their insurance at all. In a study of two of the largest emergency medicine staffing firms in the US, health economist Zack Cooper found costs to patients went up more than 80 percent after a corporate interest took ownership. Xinmei Liu for Vox Meanwhile, to minimize costs, private equity-owned staffing firms often replaced more expensive physicians with nurse practitioners and physician associates . It was a move likely to worsen patient care: While these professionals do highly skilled work in a variety of clinical settings , the emergency department is one place where care outcomes are more likely to suffer if a doctor isn’t involved . In a demonstration of how deeply invested private equity was in emergency care, these firms set in motion a system to generate cheap labor, trained to private equity’s productivity maximizing specifications. For-profit health care companies, including private equity-invested ones, founded a glut of residency training programs in the late 2010s. A 2021 study projected the move would lead to an oversupply of more than 7,800 emergency medicine doctors by 2030. According to reporting by Lever , the private equity-funded staffing firm American Physician Partners told investors they expected the surplus to eventually save them an expected $20 million in annual payroll costs. There are good reasons to believe that private equity’s soup-to-nuts transformation of emergency care has had a devastating effect on physician morale and patient care — and many emergency doctors say both are true . In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst.” Emergency medicine has long been among the most stressful physician specialties. However, in recent years, the burnout rate has climbed to 63 percent , according to a 2024 Medscape survey, and the specialty is losing popularity among medical students. Doctors’ decision-making authority is their currency; “To have that taken away because of leadership and ownership models that negate that authority is really disheartening, and leads to burnout and, really, moral injury,” says Aisha Terry , a Washington, DC, emergency room doctor and president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, an advocacy and education nonprofit. In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst” Meanwhile, finding concrete data proving patient harms is difficult.

Getty Images With the new government completing 100 days at the center and the US Fed giving in to the clamor with a resounding 50 bps rate cut, retail investors in Mutual Funds (MFs) who were waiting on the sidelines for the dust to settle can look at deploying monies in their chosen asset classes basis risk appetite and time horizon. Mutual Funds as an investment vehicle have caught the attention of investors with several industry initiatives, influencers and fintech startups unitedly attracting inflows into the industry. Today, with high HNI and retail participation in Mutual Funds, we are currently witnessing Rs 23,547 crores of monthly SIPs which are at lifetime highs and a staggering Rs 66.7 lakh crores AUM being attributed to the MF industry. This shows the strong performance and importance of MF for investors – both new and experienced. An important aspect today for investors is the multitude of MF categories and schemes to select from (45 Asset Management Companies at last count) makes the choice both bewildering and overwhelming. Thankfully, at times like these, a wealth manager can come to a UHNI/HNI clients rescue and navigate the vast MF universe for them. SEBI via the MF re-categorisation norms in 2018 straitjacketed MFs in distinct MF categories with each AMC being instructed to fit their current and new schemes into these with an aim to simplify MF investments for investors and standardise performance comparison etc. Best MF to invest Looking for the best mutual funds to invest? Here are our recommendations. View Details » One is reminded of famous quote attributed to Warren Buffet: “MFs are like children. Never have more than you can manage”. MFs are inherently diversified with each having an underlying of 30 to 60 + stocks / bonds on average. Hence, the incremental diversification benefit by holding many MF schemes reduces progressively. As a financial expert, we suggest consolidating your MF investments into an optimum number of 8 to 12 schemes at maximum for UHNIs/HNIs with a corpus of 1 cr for mutual funds as a category. The below table gives suggested MF allocation to UHNIs/HNIs belonging to 3 different risk profiles assuming a 1 Cr. corpus and a timeline of 5 – 7 years. Keeping Buffet’s maxim in mind, the number of MF schemes have been limited to 12.

Cash, Debt, Hybrid and Gold fund allocation may be done in lumpsum. Thematic equity (i.e. Infra) / Sectoral equity (i.e. Financial Services) funds carry higher risk than diversified equity funds (i.e. large cap / flexicap / value). International equity funds carry higher risk than domestic equity funds Number of funds can be further reduced by choosing Hybrid funds which are a mix of cash, debt, equity and gold While several retail investors are becoming HNIs with a higher growth in income and diversification of income streams, it is important that professionals manage your MFs beyond a point of time as DIY investing requires time commitments as your portfolio expands. Hence, several clients prefer to have an expert wealth manager or trusted financial advisor allocate and manage their portfolio to act on underperforming schemes in a timely manner and actively manage their mutual funds keeping in mind the taxation and capital gains horizon and slabs. All of this collectively leads to a better predictability on your portfolio performance in line with your short term and long-term goals.

Late last week, the Japanese automaker put out some very disappointing global sales numbers , and now some are worried it’ll once again fall short of its fiscal year profit forecast. Of course, this was already cut once before back in July.

Its two biggest problem areas just happened to be China and the U.S. , which is unfortunate because Nissan relies on those two countries alone for about half of its global sales volume. In fact, Nissan’s U.S. dealerships are earning about 70 percent less than they were at the same time last year. Advertisement Related Content Nissan may never recover in America Nissan is just fine with dealers losing money selling its cars Related Content Nissan may never recover in America Nissan is just fine with dealers losing money selling its cars Here’s what’s going on in those two countries and why two completely different issues are leading to Nissan’s financial hardships. From Bloomberg : In China, sales slumped 24% — bad, but arguably not much of a surprise given Nissan is closing a plant and cutting production capacity after years of deteriorating performance. The company is having a hard time keeping up with local carmakers offering electric vehicles loaded with high-tech features that appeal to Chinese consumers. In the US — where Chinese cars are scarcely available due to tariffs — Nissan is facing an altogether different issue. The company doesn’t have any hybrid models at a time gas-electric models are in vogue. Sales slipped 0.1%, the first monthly decrease since April. The dip came despite Nissan’s efforts to tame inventory in North America by increasing incentive spending. CEO Makoto Uchida said in July his focus was on clearing the stock of cars on dealer lots, which doesn’t seem to be going so well. Advertisement As I mentioned earlier, Nissan’s U.S. dealers have seen a 70 percent decrease in profits over the last year, and that comes despite the fact the company is spending a ton of money on advertising and incentives, Bloomberg reports. Many Nissan dealers are having trouble even moving 2023 models. It’s not a good situation. “To clear the inventory, Nissan will either have to bring in new models or cut prices,” said James Hong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities Korea. While the carmaker recently launched the Infiniti QX80 sport utility vehicle and Nissan Kicks crossover, the two are lower-volume models and will do little to reduce the stockpile, he said. Meanwhile, Nissan’s top-selling EV in the US — the Ariya SUV — isn’t eligible for the federal government’s purchase tax credit of up to $7,500 because it’s made in Japan. Nissan has gotten around this somewhat by taking advantage of credits available to leased vehicles. It’s offering leases for as low as $199 a month, making the Ariya one of the better EV bargains around. Even so, data from car-shopping researcher Edmunds show Nissan still has among the highest levels of inventory in the country among major automakers. Advertisement Sure, Nissan says it’s going to launch seven new hybrids and EVs in the U.S. by 2028, but who knows what the automotive landscape will look like at that point. It’s anyone’s guess if folks will even wait that long for a Nissan EV or hybrid rather than just getting one of the other dozens of great cars already on the market. Here’s more on Nissan’s financial situation, from Bloomberg : The automaker’s operating profit plunged last quarter by an alarming 99%, leading management to lower their outlook for the year ending in March by 12% to ¥500 billion ($3.5 billion). The company also trimmed its full-year sales target to 3.65 million units. Equity investors are clearly concerned — Nissan’s shares are down 27% this year — and credit analysts are starting to pen reports with alarming headlines. S&P Global cut Nissan’s credit rating to junk in March of last year. The automaker nevertheless plans to buy back ¥79.9 billion of its shares from Renault as part of an agreement to rebalance its alliance with the French carmaker. [...] Aside from monthly sales reports, investors will get their next look at Nissan’s results in November, when the company is due to report its earnings for the quarter ending this month. If sales in the US and China don’t improve, those numbers are poised to disappoint. Advertisement Nissan is in a very worrying place right now, and it’s going to be very interesting to see how it gets itself out of this pickle. Hopefully, it’ll be able to float by on Rogue and Altima fleet sales until this new crop of EVs and hybrids can hit the market. Anyway, for the full rundown on Nissan’s meltdown, head on over to Bloomberg. It’s not going to get better anytime soon.

Average North American CISO pay now $565,000 • The Register Sign in / up Topics Special Features Special Features Vendor Voice Resources Resources Cybersecurity Month 12 Average North American CISO pay now $565K, mainly thanks to one weird trick 12 Best way to boost your package is to leave, or pretend to Iain Thomson Thu 3 Oct 2024 // 14:01 UTC A survey of nearly 700 CISOs in the US and Canada has found their pay has risen over the past year to an average of $565,000 and a median of $403,000, with the top 10 percent of execs pulling in over $1 million. (That's about £426,000, £304,000, and £754,000, respectively.) The data showed that by far the most effective way to boost your pay was to switch jobs, or at least threaten to, and get a counter offer from your original employer. Both moves bring an average compensation increase of 31 percent. By contrast, just doing your job and getting an annual raise would increase the average compensation by just 6.3 percent, according to data from IANS Research and recruitment firm Artico. However, at the moment fewer CISOs are considering this route. This fifth annual survey found that staff turnover has nearly halved since the heady days of the 2022s, when 21 percent of those surveyed had moved jobs in the previous 12 months. "We believe it's largely a macroeconomic situation," Nick Kakolowski, senior research director at IANS Research, told The Register . "It's a combination of businesses being conservative and waiting for a little bit more stability, and CISOs being conservative and waiting for a little bit more stability. We're seeing more movement starting in the market, and we expect that to continue. We don't have a great sense of when it's going to get back to – or if it's going to get back to – the tons of movement days of the early 2020s, and post-pandemic, but we expect a much more active year next year." 70% of CISOs worry their org is at risk of a material cyber attack US senator claims UnitedHealth's CEO, board appointed 'unqualified' CISO CISOs' salary growth slows – with pay gap widening AWS CISO tells The Reg: In the AI gold rush, folks are forgetting application security If you're looking for the most lucrative CISO job, the tech industry is the place to go. While average base pay of $407,000 isn't the highest (financial services bags that prize at $495,000), once you factor in bonuses and equity then tech is the clear winner at $721,000. "In today's environment of cash preservation, we're seeing companies utilize equity more often than cash as a negotiation and retention tool," explained Steve Martano, cyber recruiter at Artico Search. "Public companies are using equity to entice new security leaders and to retain them, privately held companies similarly leverage equity-rich packages to preserve EBITDA." At the other end of the scale is education, where average base pay is $243,000, while hospitals and clinics come in at $334,000. For the first time this category had to be split from the rest of the healthcare industry, because the disparities are so wide – $465,000 was the average for pharma and medical insurers. Another trick to boost compensation is to go back to the office – at least part-time. The survey found that hybrid or office workers got more than a 6 percent increase in their pay last year. One in five remote workers saw their pay packet stay the same last year, and 45 percent got a less than 5 percent increase. The rich are also getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. Among the top 10 percent of best-paid CISOs, 23 percent saw their pay rise by over 20 percent. Among the 25 percent of the lowest-paid CISOs, two thirds said their compensation hadn't changed, or had risen less than five percent. And as with most jobs in the US, it also matters where you work, Kakolowski opined. California tops the pay scales, unsurprisingly, and CISOs are more than twice as likely to get some form of equity – reflecting the startup culture on the West Coast. The North East is the second most lucrative place to work, but outside of these two the South East was the most rewarding. Kakolowski cited the financial services groupings around North Carolina, the thriving biotech scene, and Texas's burgeoning tech sector. Canadian CISOs reported the lowest earnings, but at least they have cheap healthcare to make up for it. ® Get our Tech Resources Share More about CISO Employment IT Governance More like these × More about CISO Employment IT Governance Narrower topics Employment Tribunal Freelancing Job cuts Layoff Trade Union Umbrella Firm Working from Home Broader topics Security More about Share 12 COMMENTS More about CISO Employment IT Governance More like these × More about CISO Employment IT Governance Narrower topics Employment Tribunal Freelancing Job cuts Layoff Trade Union Umbrella Firm Working from Home Broader topics Security TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Why send a message when you can get your Zoom digital video clone to read the script?

The S&P 500 is almost never this expensive. It’s a disaster waiting to happen. Read full article Brett Arends Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 5:30 PM 6 min read Link Copied 11 In this article: The S&P 500 is teetering on the edge. - ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection Nothing says we’re teetering on the brink of World War III quite like a U.S. stock market that’s even more expensive, in relation to its underlying fundamentals, than it was at the peak in 1929. The issue isn’t just the terrifying situation in the Middle East, either. The U.S. economy is also slowing, the Federal Reserve just slashed interest rates, and we face a pivotal presidential election. Oh, and China, the world’s second-largest economy, is stumbling . Most Read from MarketWatch ‘I’m scared to death’: My wife asked for a divorce after 21 years. She wants to buy a house with our savings, but promises to help pay my mortgage. ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? The S&P 500 is too tech-heavy. This alternative ETF keeps beating it. ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? Yet the S&P 500 SPX index, which is the cornerstone of almost every reader’s 401(k), IRA and other retirement accounts, currently sells for a higher multiple of average earnings than at almost any time in history. The so-called cyclically adjusted or Shiller price-to-earnings ratio , named after Nobel Prize winner and Yale finance professor Robert Shiller, is currently 35. This ratio compares stock prices to the average corporate earnings of the past decade, adjusted for inflation. Shiller was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics for showing how it had been a powerful predictor of future investment returns. The current ratio is higher than the peak in 1929 (when it hit 33), let alone the late 1960s (when it was just 22). Both proved terrible times for investors. Actually, on this measure, the S&P 500 has only been more expensive on two occasions before this summer: During the Greatest Bubble in History from 1998 to 2001, and during the post-COVID mania of 2021-22. Both also proved bad times to be an investor. Check out this chart from Mindful Advisory, a money-management firm in New Jersey. Using Shiller’s own data, it tracks all the monthly cyclically adjusted PE ratios since 1881 from the cheapest (bottom left) to the most expensive (top right). - As Shaggy used to say on Scooby-Doo: Yikes! This isn’t an isolated indicator, either. Warren Buffett used to say his favorite measure was to compare the market value of all U.S. stocks to the U.S. annual gross domestic product. Story continues By this, too, we are up in the clouds. Stocks are currently valued at 190% of U.S. GDP . That’s about twice the average since the 1970s. Or consider the measure known as the Tobin’s Q, coined by economist James Tobin (another Nobel laureate), which compared the market value of U.S. stocks to the supposed cost of rebuilding all these companies’ assets from scratch. It, too, is at all-time record levels and about twice its historic average . The usual riposte from Wall Street bulls goes along the lines of, “Bears have been saying that for years, and they’ve been wrong and missed out on massive gains.” They’re absolutely right. But their argument risks double-counting. On the one hand, the higher the stock market goes, the bigger its recent historic returns. Yet on the other, by definition, the higher it goes, the lower its future returns. The argument also ignores risks as well as potential returns. The problem for us ordinary investors isn’t that the S&P 500 is definitely going to collapse, or crash, or even that it will necessarily produce terrible returns over the next five or 10 years. It’s that, as the Bard of Broadway, Damon Runyon, once said, while the race isn’t always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, “that’s the way the smart money bets.” How much do you want to bet on this asset class, at these odds? Mark Cecchini, a certified financial planner in Lehigh Valley, Pa., summed up the situation pretty well in a recent tweet. The “recency bias right now is so strong that no one thinks about the lost decades of the S&P,” he wrote. “From 2000 to 2010, the annualized return of the S&P was -0.97% … Personally I’m not willing to bet the probability of achieving my family’s goals on 1 asset class dominated by 7 companies.” No kidding. Those seven companies — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA, Google/Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Facebook/Meta META, and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B — account for about a third of the entire S&P 500 by value and, even crazier, about one-sixth of all the listed stocks in the world. At these levels, the S&P 500 seems to have priced in little margin for risk at a time when risks seem even higher than usual. The chances that it will produce terrific returns from here over the next decade must logically be slimmer than they have been. And they are probably slimmer than most investors think. Vanguard recently reported that U.S. investors’ expectations are now at their highest levels since it began surveying back in 2017. And the expectations are higher than even Vanguard’s own forecasts. Ben Inker, the co-head of asset allocation at white-shoe Boston fund firm GMO, warns in a new research paper that “lost decades” for U.S. investors — long periods of about 10 years when you earn nothing — have been more common than we may think. Inker was writing not only about the stock market but about the so-called “balanced” or “60/40” portfolio, consisting of 60% in the S&P 500 and 40% in the U.S. bond market. Since 1900, Inker writes, “there have been six periods, averaging 11 years each, in which an investor in a 60/40 portfolio would have either broken even relative to inflation or, even worse, lost money in real terms.” Everyone will have their own thoughts. Many investors, buoyed by years of a booming S&P 500 and this year’s rally in bonds, will ignore the warnings and just stick with 60/40. Institutions will pin their faith in “alternatives,” typically meaning high-fee entities like hedge funds and private equity. (Those are brilliant wealth creators for the people who run them. Not so much for their investors.) Doug Ramsey at investment group Leuthold Group models an “All Asset No Authority” portfolio that has done as well as 60/40 since the early 1970s, but with no lost decades: It includes U.S. small-caps IWM, developed international stocks VEA, gold SGOL, commodities GSG and REITs VNQ, as well as the S&P 500 SPY and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds IEF. My own preferences include U.S. and international small-company stocks, which seem to have missed out on the S&P 500 mania; resource stocks, which seem to march to a different beat to the rest of the market ; and inflation-protected Treasury bonds. Make of that what you will. It’s your money and your choice. If the S&P 500 goes vertical from here, you can have a good laugh at my expense. I don’t mind interesting times. I just expect stocks to be cheaper than they are now when I encounter them. Most Read from MarketWatch ‘I believe she made a big mistake’: My wife put her paycheck into a bank account with her inheritance. Do I now own 50% of those funds? ‘I’m trapped between warring siblings’: My late father left a ledger with $80,000 in unpaid loans to my brothers. Can the executor force them to pay? Schwab leads list of banks expected to profit most in 2025 from Fed’s rate cuts ‘My husband blew a gasket’: I bought a $20,000 Toyota SUV using financing. My spouse said, ‘Pay it off immediately.’ Did I get a bad deal?

I’m a founder, writer and lecturer focusing on VC funds. Following Oct 3, 2024, 01:20pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Flora Fertility, heyflora.co Flora Fertility Reproductive health and family planning are becoming the forefront of social discourse, and a promising InsurTech startup just closed a fresh $1.5M pre-seed funding round - led by Highline Beta with co-investment by Cartography Capital and Everywhere Ventures - bringing them a step closer to transforming the landscape of fertility coverage. Flora , co-founded by Laura McDonald and Dr. Christy Lane, is introducing the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy, aiming to bridge the significant gap in fertility treatment funding. The Fertility Market: A Landscape of Investments and Challenges The fertility market has been a hotbed for private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments in recent years. Dr. Christy Lane , one of Flora’s Co-Founder, observes, "We're seeing clinic roll-ups, particularly in the US, where PE is going in and rolling up those clinics. In some cases, it's a good thing where you're seeing better services, better access to care." However, despite these investments and advancements in fertility science, a critical issue persists: the funding gap for fertility treatments. According to the World Health Organization, infertility is a global health issue, affecting one in six to one in five people who may need some form of fertility treatment. Laura McDonald , Flora’s Co-founder, explains "Depending on where you are, 60 to 80% of people still have no coverage through their work or health plans, or limited coverage." This lack of coverage is particularly pronounced for individuals working in small to medium-sized businesses or those who are self-employed. Flora's Solution: Individually-Owned Fertility Insurance Flora's innovative approach centers on creating the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy. Lane elaborates, "We've spent decades really understanding the clinical research and the claims patterns for infertility treatment. That's what's allowed us to be able to develop these individual risk underwriting models and actuarial or pricing models." MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor This individual risk model sets Flora apart from traditional group insurance plans, which don't perform individual underwriting. As a result, Flora can provide more affordable coverage for individuals and small groups, a market segment previously underserved by existing fertility coverage options. Target Demographics and Market Potential Flora is initially targeting women aged 20 to 34, a demographic increasingly concerned about their future fertility. Lane shares a striking statistic: "50% of young women are concerned about their future fertility before even trying to conceive." This concern is particularly prevalent among women who are prioritizing career development or other life goals before starting a family. As McDonald notes, "They don't want their biological clock to necessarily dictate their life journey. They want to focus on their career and other things." The Technology Behind Flora Flora's innovative approach extends beyond its insurance model to its technological infrastructure. Lane explains, "What we're building is very unique, even in the InsurTech space, which is called a digital MGA (Managing General Agent)." This digital platform allows for wide distribution through channels such as health apps and small to medium businesses. The company has developed a proprietary underwriting engine that enables real-time quoting and fast coverage approvals. Moreover, the data collected through this process opens up exciting possibilities for AI and machine learning applications. McDonald adds, "There are huge opportunities for AI, large language models in improving our ability to better understand risk, but also enable us to better understand how to help women mitigate their own risk through things like lifestyle changes." Flora's Data-Driven Approach: Merging Wearable Tech and Lifestyle Insights to Revolutionize Fertility Support Dr. Christy Lane brings a wealth of experience to Flora's innovative approach to fertility. With a background that includes founding the Wearable Health Lab at Stanford , Lane has spent years investigating the intricate connections between lifestyle factors and fertility. "Part of our value is our deep understanding of what predicts infertility, particularly lifestyle," Lane explains. Her research has delved into how physical activity, sleep patterns, nutrition, and even data from wearable devices and IoT can impact fertility. This expertise forms the foundation of Flora's unique offering: personalized lifestyle journeys for women. By collecting and analyzing data, Flora aims to provide tailored, non-clinical recommendations to improve natural conception chances. For women already on a fertility journey, the company offers practical advice on sleep optimization, physical activity, and nutrition. Lane emphasizes, "We're not just providing insurance; we're offering a holistic approach to reproductive health." This data-driven, lifestyle-focused strategy sets Flora apart in the fertility market, promising a more comprehensive and personalized approach to family planning. Comprehensive Coverage and Community Support Flora's coverage is designed to be comprehensive, including diagnostics, drugs, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF). But the company's vision extends beyond mere financial coverage. Lane, drawing from her personal experience with fertility treatments, emphasizes the importance of community support: "Part of what we want to do is create community within women who become members of the Flora community and policyholders to make sure that these women understand infertility, understand their potential risks, and also lifestyle changes and things that they can do to reduce their risk of infertility." The company plans to provide personalized lifestyle recommendations to help women improve their chances of conceiving naturally. They're also establishing partnerships with sexual health platforms, menstrual tracking apps, and clinics to create a holistic reproductive health ecosystem. The Alternative to Egg Freezing Flora positions itself as an alternative or an addition to egg freezing, a procedure that has gained popularity but comes with its own set of challenges and uncertainties. McDonald shares an anecdote that encapsulates their value proposition: "This young woman came up to me... She said, 'We're being told that we have to freeze our eggs, that that's our insurance policy for our future fertility. But what you made me realize is that I actually just need an insurance policy, literally, I just need an insurance policy.'" McDonald illustrates the cost-effectiveness of their approach with an example: "My daughter Molly, who plans to go to law school, can freeze her eggs in her 20s for, say $10,000 or she can buy a Flora policy, and depending on the ages she buys it, it might be $20 a month." Overcoming Industry Challenges; why Flora and why now? When addressing the common questions surrounding their fertility insurance product. "Many people ask why this hasn't been done before, and why established insurance companies don't simply adopt our model," McDonald explains. The answer lies in the complex landscape of insurance and the unique challenges of fertility coverage. Traditional insurance relies heavily on established mortality tables and risk models for areas like death, disability, and natural disasters. However, fertility insurance requires the creation of entirely new models. "We've spent over 18 months building out these risk models," McDonald reveals, highlighting the extensive work involved. This process combines decades of expertise from team members like Dr. Christy Lane, who has studied the field for over 20 years, with innovative approaches to data analysis and risk assessment, and Somil Jain, a leading actuary for transformational digital insurance models. McDonald points out that the insurance industry often relies on InsurTech companies like Flora to pioneer such new models and bring innovative products to market. The challenges extend beyond model creation to navigating regulatory environments and securing capacity partners for claim payouts. Despite these hurdles, Flora has succeeded thanks to their team's diverse background and support from partners like InsureTech NY. McDonald emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in finding and utilizing new data sets to create novel underwriting, risk, and pricing models. Additionally, Flora's strategic advantage in distribution positions them to rapidly reach millions of women, increasing their odds of becoming a pioneer in this untapped market of individual fertility insurance. The Future of Fertility Coverage Flora's ambitions extend beyond fertility treatment coverage. The company envisions a long-term model that supports women throughout their reproductive journey and beyond. As McDonald explains, "We can ideally stay with you before the baby, when you have the baby, whether you need treatment or not, and after." Future plans include expanding coverage to areas such as postpartum depression treatment, pelvic floor treatment, and even perimenopause and menopause support. This comprehensive approach aims to address the full spectrum of women's reproductive health needs. Conclusion: A New Paradigm in Reproductive Health Coverage Flora represents a significant shift in how we approach fertility and reproductive health insurance. By offering individually-owned policies based on personalized risk assessments, the company is making fertility treatment more accessible and affordable for a broader demographic. As reproductive health continues to gain prominence in public discourse, innovations like Flora's individually-owned fertility insurance policies may well become a cornerstone of comprehensive healthcare coverage. With its blend of InsurTech innovation, data-driven risk assessment, and community-focused approach - Flora is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of fertility coverage and women's health support. In a world where reproductive autonomy and financial stability often seem at odds, Flora's approach offers a promising solution. By providing women with the financial tools to take control of their fertility journey, Flora is not just selling insurance – it's offering peace of mind and expanded reproductive choices to a generation of women balancing health challenges, emotional and career needs with family planning.

Support Vox Member Exclusive Policy / Health Care The profit-obsessed monster destroying American emergency rooms Private equity decimated emergency care in the United States — without you even noticing. by Keren Landman, MD Oct 3, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC Facebook Link Xinmei Liu for Vox Keren Landman, MD is a senior reporter covering public health, emerging infectious diseases, the health workforce, and health justice at Vox. Keren is trained as a physician, researcher, and epidemiologist and has served as a disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Facebook Link John didn’t start his career mad. He trained as an emergency medicine doctor in a tidily run Midwestern emergency room about a decade ago. He loved the place, especially the way its management was so responsive to the doctors’ needs, offering extra staffing when things got busy and paid administrative time for teaching other trainees. Doctors provided most of the care, occasionally overseeing the work of nurse practitioners and physician associates . He signed on to start there full-time shortly after finishing his residency. A month before his start date, a private equity firm bought the practice. “I can’t even tell you how quickly it changed,” John says. The ratio of doctors to other clinicians flipped, shrinking doctor hours to a minimum as the firm moved to save on salaries. John — who is being referred to by a pseudonym due to concerns over professional repercussions — quit and found a job at another emergency room in a different state. It too soon sold out to the same private equity firm. Then it happened again, and then again. Small emergency rooms “kept getting gobbled up by these gigantic corporations so fast,” he said. By the time doctors tried to jump ship to another ER, “they were already sold out.” At all of the private equity-acquired ERs where John worked, things changed almost overnight: In addition to having their hours cut, doctors were docked pay if they didn’t evaluate new arrivals within 25 minutes of them walking through the door, leading to hasty orders for “kitchen sink” workups geared mostly toward productivity — not toward real cost-effectiveness or diagnostic precision. Amid all of this, cuts to their hours when ER volumes were low meant John and his colleagues’ pay was all over the place. Patient care was suffering “from the toe sprains all the way up to the gunshot wounds and heart attacks,” says John. His experience wasn’t an anomaly — it was happening in emergency rooms across the country. “All of my colleagues were experiencing the same thing.” “Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” At times, the short staffing combined with the pressure to churn patients led to deadly shortcuts. John remembers rushing to evaluate one patient and missing his extensive history of alcohol abuse. The patient spent hours getting tests directed at the wrong diagnosis. John could have put together a more appropriate plan if he’d had a few more minutes to sit down and get a better history, but by the time he realized what was going on, the patient was too severely ill. He died in the intensive care unit two days later. “Is that 100 percent because of that staffing? Probably not,” says John. “But if I wasn’t so stressed about jumping into that patient room, making sure my door-to-provider time was less than 25 minutes …” The hypothetical hangs in the air. “Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” Xinmei Liu for Vox The story of how private equity has been able to so thoroughly debilitate emergency care is one of the more dramatic examples of how corporate interests are corrosive to America’s health care system — and how powerless they leave individual consumers. Today, private equity continues to operate a shocking quarter of ERs nationwide , as of March 2024. Still, there’s some hope: Academics, patient advocates, and doctors say you can make defensive moves to protect your finances and care before, during, and after you or a loved one visits an ER. Understanding private equity’s transformation of America’s emergency rooms is the first step. How private equity sunk its claws into emergency care Modern private equity got its start in the early 1980s, when a free-market acolyte — and former member of the Nixon administration — completed the first major “ leveraged buyout .” Using mostly borrowed money, William Simon and his partner bought a greeting card company, extracted huge fees , and then sold it for a massive profit less than two years later. Over the next few decades, what was then called the leveraged buyout industry moved into other sectors. Firms flipped businesses to yield spectacular profits, often cutting corners on the products and services they offered, eliminating jobs, and reducing employee benefits. It was only a matter of time until the industry, now rebranded as private equity, turned its gaze on the US’s $4 trillion health care sector, which was already becoming increasingly commercialized as nonprofit health systems consolidated, paid their executives ever more extravagant salaries , and otherwise played business hardball. Private equity takeovers in health care started around 2000 and have steadily increased since; when several big banks crumbled in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity’s growth only accelerated. Emergency medicine wasn’t always an appealing target for private equity. Physician staffing in many emergency rooms around the country was traditionally handled by co-op-like groups, run by working doctors , that contracted with hospitals. In the 1990s, ex-physicians and businesspeople began taking ownership of these so-called contract management groups (CMGs). As they did, they started acting more like for-profit businesses, centralizing decision-making and earnings. The easier it was to make decisions that prioritized profits, the more money CMGs made — and the more attractive they became to private equity. Through the mid- to late-2010s , private equity firms swallowed up a shocking number of American emergency rooms, leaving in their wake a generationally hollowed-out system for providing emergency care to people across the country. Private equity firms and other corporate interests owned nearly 9 percent of ER doctor groups in 2009; by 2019, they owned 22 percent . The wave of takeovers and consolidations peaked in 2021 but carries on all over the US, especially in Florida, Texas, and other parts of the South and West where the firms have been most aggressive . Doctors trying to practice medicine the way they’d been trained to — with a priority on patient care, not profits — found they couldn’t outrun the monster. Private equity’s dominance persisted even after the federal No Surprises Act , enacted in 2022, made many of their most profitable practices illegal. Lots of for-profit models are a bad fit for health care, but of all of them, private equity is perhaps the worst, says Eileen O’Grady , director of programs at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group: “It basically takes the for-profit model and makes it so much more extractive and so much more harmful and risky.” Private equity puts profit above all else To understand what makes private equity such a malignant force in health care, you have to understand its uniquely craven and purposefully opaque corporate structure. Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you want it to make more money. You have a few options: You can plow all your profits back into the business until it grows — what business school types call organic growth. Alternatively, you can get a bank loan. If you’re really ambitious, you can sell shares of your lemonade stand to the general public by promising them a good return on their investment. There’s another option here, one that will make you richer quicker: You can sell all or most of the stand to the rich kid at the end of the street. He’s offering you a lot of money for it — more than you’d get over the short term from the other options. That’s because he’s taken out a huge loan to pay for the deal. But there are a couple of catches: First, if he runs into financial trouble (which he very well might, since he’s been buying up lemonade stands all over town), he’ll sell it off for parts, leaving the neighborhood lemonade-less. This will cost him nothing personally because he used the lemonade stand as collateral for that big loan. The second and perhaps more important catch is that this kid is buying your lemonade stand in order to sell it. He doesn’t care about lemonade or the people who like it. His strategy is to make the stand’s balance sheet look so attractive that a few years later, another investor will buy it at a premium — or if that fails, then yes, to sell it off for parts. A year down the road, odds are high your precious lemonade stand will be a sad shadow of what it once was, or it might not exist at all. That kid is private equity. Xinmei Liu for Vox When private equity comes for a lemonade stand (or for Toys “R” Us , Samsonite , Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams , or for any of the thousands of businesses these firms have taken over since they rose to prominence in the late 1980s), the result is often a sad story about the decline of a legacy brand — shoddy products and lost jobs. Depressing, but not a life-and-death issue. When private equity comes for health care, though, the result is human suffering: Elderly and intellectually disabled people sitting in puddles of their own waste , sick patients not getting the care they need , worse outcomes for patients . It’s not just lemonade. People’s lives are at stake. The way private equity gets into emergency care is by buying out the CMGs that manage physician staffing — that is to say, the firms only buy the clinicians themselves. It’s a different model than when private equity invests in other areas of health care. When firms buy hospitals, nursing homes, medical practices, rehabilitation facilities, and group homes, they acquire not only staff, but also buildings, land, and medical equipment. In the case of emergency care, “private equity doesn’t pay the hospital rent, they don’t hire the nurses, they don’t pay the electric bills, they don’t provide any of the equipment,” says Robert McNamara , chair of the emergency medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. The hospital still handles those finances. “They’re just working the labor force. … The highest-cost thing on their expense side is the board-certified emergency physician.” When emergency rooms first caught the eye of private equity firms, the prospective investors offered the physician owners of CMGs huge payouts. Leon Adelman , an emergency medicine doctor who leads the staffing firm Ivy Clinicians and writes a workforce-focused newsletter , says the owners faced a tough choice: “‘Do I do what is ethical and feels right … and I get a nice going-away party and maybe a watch or something — or do I get $10 million?’” “What they were buying was the ability to charge patients who were consuming a non-shoppable service,” Adelman says — one for which patients are unable to compare prices. If you’re having a heart attack, you’re not going to call around to hospitals to find out who is going to give you the best deal. Hospitals that increasingly have profit on the brain often found private equity a more attractive partner than doctor-owned CMGs. The firms are flush with cash, which means they don’t look to the hospitals to shore up their finances. “They won’t ask you for a penny,” Adelman explains. “They’re making plenty of money.” Once a private equity firm bought an emergency room, there were two levers it could pull to make a profit: It could maximize what it reaped from patients who’d received services, and it could cut what it spent paying the clinicians who provided those services. Doing both at the same time has made emergency medicine practically unrecognizable. Burned-out doctors, screwed-over patients Under new private equity ownership, ERs adopted an assortment of unsavory practices. Firms not only pressured clinicians to see patients faster, as illustrated by John’s experience, but to recommend hospital admission for more patients. They also dramatically raised the price tags for a range of emergency services, resulting in back-breakingly large bills for patients nationwide, like ones charging thousands of dollars for glue applied to a half-inch wound. To avoid having to negotiate those astronomical bills with the expert hagglers at insurance companies, firms kept their ERs from participating in many insurance networks. It was easier to collect on a so-called balance bill — the portion of a medical bill not paid for by a patient’s insurer — if the care a patient had received wasn’t covered by their insurance at all. In a study of two of the largest emergency medicine staffing firms in the US, health economist Zack Cooper found costs to patients went up more than 80 percent after a corporate interest took ownership. Xinmei Liu for Vox Meanwhile, to minimize costs, private equity-owned staffing firms often replaced more expensive physicians with nurse practitioners and physician associates . It was a move likely to worsen patient care: While these professionals do highly skilled work in a variety of clinical settings , the emergency department is one place where care outcomes are more likely to suffer if a doctor isn’t involved . In a demonstration of how deeply invested private equity was in emergency care, these firms set in motion a system to generate cheap labor, trained to private equity’s productivity maximizing specifications. For-profit health care companies, including private equity-invested ones, founded a glut of residency training programs in the late 2010s. A 2021 study projected the move would lead to an oversupply of more than 7,800 emergency medicine doctors by 2030. According to reporting by Lever , the private equity-funded staffing firm American Physician Partners told investors they expected the surplus to eventually save them an expected $20 million in annual payroll costs. There are good reasons to believe that private equity’s soup-to-nuts transformation of emergency care has had a devastating effect on physician morale and patient care — and many emergency doctors say both are true . In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst.” Emergency medicine has long been among the most stressful physician specialties. However, in recent years, the burnout rate has climbed to 63 percent , according to a 2024 Medscape survey, and the specialty is losing popularity among medical students. Doctors’ decision-making authority is their currency; “To have that taken away because of leadership and ownership models that negate that authority is really disheartening, and leads to burnout and, really, moral injury,” says Aisha Terry , a Washington, DC, emergency room doctor and president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, an advocacy and education nonprofit. In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst” Meanwhile, finding concrete data proving patient harms is difficult.

Here are our recommendations. View Details » One is reminded of famous quote attributed to Warren Buffet: “MFs are like children. Never have more than you can manage”. MFs are inherently diversified with each having an underlying of 30 to 60 + stocks / bonds on average. Hence, the incremental diversification benefit by holding many MF schemes reduces progressively. As a financial expert, we suggest consolidating your MF investments into an optimum number of 8 to 12 schemes at maximum for UHNIs/HNIs with a corpus of 1 cr for mutual funds as a category. The below table gives suggested MF allocation to UHNIs/HNIs belonging to 3 different risk profiles assuming a 1 Cr. corpus and a timeline of 5 – 7 years. Keeping Buffet’s maxim in mind, the number of MF schemes have been limited to 12.

Cash, Debt, Hybrid and Gold fund allocation may be done in lumpsum. Thematic equity (i.e. Infra) / Sectoral equity (i.e. Financial Services) funds carry higher risk than diversified equity funds (i.e. large cap / flexicap / value). International equity funds carry higher risk than domestic equity funds Number of funds can be further reduced by choosing Hybrid funds which are a mix of cash, debt, equity and gold While several retail investors are becoming HNIs with a higher growth in income and diversification of income streams, it is important that professionals manage your MFs beyond a point of time as DIY investing requires time commitments as your portfolio expands. Hence, several clients prefer to have an expert wealth manager or trusted financial advisor allocate and manage their portfolio to act on underperforming schemes in a timely manner and actively manage their mutual funds keeping in mind the taxation and capital gains horizon and slabs. All of this collectively leads to a better predictability on your portfolio performance in line with your short term and long-term goals.

Nissan is in deep trouble as profits plunge for dealers and the company Jalopnik Kotaku Quartz The Root The Inventory Search Free Newsletters Editions Español Deutsch Français About Quartz Advisor Explore our other sites We may earn a commission from links on this page Business News Profits for both dealers and the automaker itself are plunging fast By Andy Kalmowitz / Jalopnik Published October 2, 2024 We may earn a commission from links on this page . Photo : Brandon Bell ( Getty Images ) In This Story NSANY -0.50% RNLSY +0.13% SPGI -0.30% Nissan is in some deep trouble right now, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to get better anytime soon. Late last week, the Japanese automaker put out some very disappointing global sales numbers , and now some are worried it’ll once again fall short of its fiscal year profit forecast. Of course, this was already cut once before back in July.

Its two biggest problem areas just happened to be China and the U.S. , which is unfortunate because Nissan relies on those two countries alone for about half of its global sales volume. In fact, Nissan’s U.S. dealerships are earning about 70 percent less than they were at the same time last year. Advertisement Related Content Nissan may never recover in America Nissan is just fine with dealers losing money selling its cars Related Content Nissan may never recover in America Nissan is just fine with dealers losing money selling its cars Here’s what’s going on in those two countries and why two completely different issues are leading to Nissan’s financial hardships. From Bloomberg : In China, sales slumped 24% — bad, but arguably not much of a surprise given Nissan is closing a plant and cutting production capacity after years of deteriorating performance. The company is having a hard time keeping up with local carmakers offering electric vehicles loaded with high-tech features that appeal to Chinese consumers. In the US — where Chinese cars are scarcely available due to tariffs — Nissan is facing an altogether different issue. The company doesn’t have any hybrid models at a time gas-electric models are in vogue. Sales slipped 0.1%, the first monthly decrease since April. The dip came despite Nissan’s efforts to tame inventory in North America by increasing incentive spending. CEO Makoto Uchida said in July his focus was on clearing the stock of cars on dealer lots, which doesn’t seem to be going so well. Advertisement As I mentioned earlier, Nissan’s U.S. dealers have seen a 70 percent decrease in profits over the last year, and that comes despite the fact the company is spending a ton of money on advertising and incentives, Bloomberg reports. Many Nissan dealers are having trouble even moving 2023 models. It’s not a good situation. “To clear the inventory, Nissan will either have to bring in new models or cut prices,” said James Hong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities Korea. While the carmaker recently launched the Infiniti QX80 sport utility vehicle and Nissan Kicks crossover, the two are lower-volume models and will do little to reduce the stockpile, he said. Meanwhile, Nissan’s top-selling EV in the US — the Ariya SUV — isn’t eligible for the federal government’s purchase tax credit of up to $7,500 because it’s made in Japan. Nissan has gotten around this somewhat by taking advantage of credits available to leased vehicles. It’s offering leases for as low as $199 a month, making the Ariya one of the better EV bargains around. Even so, data from car-shopping researcher Edmunds show Nissan still has among the highest levels of inventory in the country among major automakers. Advertisement Sure, Nissan says it’s going to launch seven new hybrids and EVs in the U.S. by 2028, but who knows what the automotive landscape will look like at that point. It’s anyone’s guess if folks will even wait that long for a Nissan EV or hybrid rather than just getting one of the other dozens of great cars already on the market. Here’s more on Nissan’s financial situation, from Bloomberg : The automaker’s operating profit plunged last quarter by an alarming 99%, leading management to lower their outlook for the year ending in March by 12% to ¥500 billion ($3.5 billion). The company also trimmed its full-year sales target to 3.65 million units. Equity investors are clearly concerned — Nissan’s shares are down 27% this year — and credit analysts are starting to pen reports with alarming headlines. S&P Global cut Nissan’s credit rating to junk in March of last year. The automaker nevertheless plans to buy back ¥79.9 billion of its shares from Renault as part of an agreement to rebalance its alliance with the French carmaker. [...] Aside from monthly sales reports, investors will get their next look at Nissan’s results in November, when the company is due to report its earnings for the quarter ending this month. If sales in the US and China don’t improve, those numbers are poised to disappoint. Advertisement Nissan is in a very worrying place right now, and it’s going to be very interesting to see how it gets itself out of this pickle. Hopefully, it’ll be able to float by on Rogue and Altima fleet sales until this new crop of EVs and hybrids can hit the market. Anyway, for the full rundown on Nissan’s meltdown, head on over to Bloomberg. It’s not going to get better anytime soon.

Advice on Navigating Equity and Inclusion in the AI Era Including DEI experts in brand strategy planning creates a goal everyone can benefit from in the workplace. DrAfter123/Getty Images By Karen Baker Drive business and brand growth with winning media strategies at Mediaweek . Hear from experts at TIME , Peloton , YouTube , Google and more, October 29-30 in New York City. Register . While AI is our latest fascination, upholding and prioritizing equity and inclusion in marketing and advertising is crucial. At Cannes Lions 2024, AI ignited essential and overdue discussions about the future of ad agencies and the creative industry. These conversations must highlight the ongoing need to promote diversity as we grow. As we plan our short- and long-term goals, it is vital to implement equitable and inclusive AI strategies proactively. As marketing and ad agencies evolve with AI, equity and inclusion must remain central. This approach is essential to adapting to the rapid advancements in AI technology and market growth. Adweek Podcast: Design Justice Can Help Brands Create More Considerate, Inclusive Work Strategic preparation and inclusive integration While many were initially pessimistic about AI (some still are), companies must now recognize the need to prepare for its growth. If preparation meets opportunity, let’s get ready. As agencies assess their role and responsibility in this opportunity, addressing ethics in using AI tools must be at the top. Here are three points to think about as you prepare to integrate. Set aside the pessimism. Create a strategic plan to integrate AI into your organization to deliver services more effectively through an inclusion lens. Sitting back and not beginning to plan for the integration can be deadly to the organization and your team. Not only is this integration part of the vision, but it will also be part of the future of business for marketing and advertising. Be forward-thinking. A 2023 McKinsey & Company article called for organizations to have “a mix of DEI experts, business leaders, and change champions who are passionate about improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workplaces.” Diversify your strategy team to include DEI experts and thought leaders who understand how AI can enhance company culture to drive further innovation and robust performance. This is the time to be bold. Including DEI experts in your strategy planning creates a goal everyone can benefit from in your workplace. Keep your finger on the pulse. Remaining aggressive in addressing the problems and obstacles related to equity and inclusion offers better creative decision-making in developing public campaigns. Under the current social landscape, it is a priority to take note of what is happening with your client’s audience and be ahead of the noise. Lessons from past technological missteps In this political and social economic climate, we cannot afford to forget the same historical errors seen and done by other technological innovations—social media, Web 2.0, and the metaverse over the last decade. Designing a strategic plan that includes AI requires a commitment to continuous employee learning and adaptation. Ethical DEI initiatives can foster innovation and a culture of collaboration as agencies provide equal learning opportunities. Here are three points to think about as you map out your strategy. Identify areas within your company culture where employees can achieve professional growth. Getting directly from your employees their strengths and areas for growth early in the hiring process benefits the company, not just the employee. It prevents dollars and hours from being spent on employees being placed in a workplace where they never felt they belonged and could excel. In the assessment, you must address unconscious bias to ensure accessibility and belonging are at the center. Invest in training your teams to understand and ethically leverage AI tools. Once you truly understand an employee’s strengths and how they will embrace AI, agencies can begin to be ahead of the curve and stay there. Foster an ethical culture of innovation. Encourage employees to experiment with AI applications and share their findings. Just like the introduction of computers and the internet, humans love experiential opportunities. So when ChatGPT becomes the fastest-growing user application in history, we know more will come. However, several communities still need access to AI education. Building AI creative-ready workforce DEI is not just the absence of cultural representation; it’s the absence of equitable access. According to Forbes , the boom of the creative economy isn’t offering most countries financial gain. Yet, U.S.-disadvantaged businesses, such as micro- and small agencies, are accessing more AI tools for content creation and ad campaigns than ever. Brands, marketers, and advertisers must value the creative impact in the evolving AI space because every room isn’t created inclusive. Here’s what to keep in mind when fostering inclusivity in AI: A concerted effort to create a more equitable industry environment is necessary—a principle and practice of Design Justice . Being mindful of limiting access to prestigious events like Cannes must be considered. Focus on the significant impacts of knowledge creation, production, and transfer. Be conscious of who benefits now from building an AI creative-ready workforce and be part of changing this outcome. Web3 Doesn’t Have the Traditional Barriers of Web2. Let’s Keep It That Way As we navigate the AI-driven transformation of agencies and the industry, we must balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and inclusive practices. We can cultivate a more innovative but fair environment by fostering equity and inclusion and ensuring equitable access to AI tools and opportunities. Let’s harness the full potential of AI while safeguarding the human essence of creativity, ensuring a vibrant and equitable future for the creative industry.

Morgan Stanley, which was OpenAI’s first official wealth management partner, in July began rolling out a genAI assistant, Debrief, built on GPT-4 . Advertisement JPMorgan also introduced a new AI assistant powered by OpenAI in August, which is designed to help employees with daily tasks, including drafting emails and reports. Goldman Sachs’ generative AI platform also uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models — and others — to support the work of its developers. ChatGPT already has 250 million weekly users, and has driven hype around AI chatbots since its release in November 2022. But its ambitions go farther than gen AI. Advertisement Ultimately, OpenAI is hoping to reach what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI — a futuristic view of machines that can pretty much do anything just as well as humans. In July, the company shared a five-level system it developed to track its progress with employees, with a spokesperson reportedly telling Bloomberg it was already at level two, “Reasoners.” At that threshold, AI can perform basic problem-solving and is on the level of a human with a doctorate degree but no access to tools. 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Average North American CISO pay now $565,000 • The Register Sign in / up Topics Special Features Special Features Vendor Voice Resources Resources Cybersecurity Month 12 Average North American CISO pay now $565K, mainly thanks to one weird trick 12 Best way to boost your package is to leave, or pretend to Iain Thomson Thu 3 Oct 2024 // 14:01 UTC A survey of nearly 700 CISOs in the US and Canada has found their pay has risen over the past year to an average of $565,000 and a median of $403,000, with the top 10 percent of execs pulling in over $1 million. (That's about £426,000, £304,000, and £754,000, respectively.) The data showed that by far the most effective way to boost your pay was to switch jobs, or at least threaten to, and get a counter offer from your original employer. Both moves bring an average compensation increase of 31 percent. By contrast, just doing your job and getting an annual raise would increase the average compensation by just 6.3 percent, according to data from IANS Research and recruitment firm Artico. However, at the moment fewer CISOs are considering this route. This fifth annual survey found that staff turnover has nearly halved since the heady days of the 2022s, when 21 percent of those surveyed had moved jobs in the previous 12 months. "We believe it's largely a macroeconomic situation," Nick Kakolowski, senior research director at IANS Research, told The Register . "It's a combination of businesses being conservative and waiting for a little bit more stability, and CISOs being conservative and waiting for a little bit more stability. We're seeing more movement starting in the market, and we expect that to continue. We don't have a great sense of when it's going to get back to – or if it's going to get back to – the tons of movement days of the early 2020s, and post-pandemic, but we expect a much more active year next year." 70% of CISOs worry their org is at risk of a material cyber attack US senator claims UnitedHealth's CEO, board appointed 'unqualified' CISO CISOs' salary growth slows – with pay gap widening AWS CISO tells The Reg: In the AI gold rush, folks are forgetting application security If you're looking for the most lucrative CISO job, the tech industry is the place to go. While average base pay of $407,000 isn't the highest (financial services bags that prize at $495,000), once you factor in bonuses and equity then tech is the clear winner at $721,000. "In today's environment of cash preservation, we're seeing companies utilize equity more often than cash as a negotiation and retention tool," explained Steve Martano, cyber recruiter at Artico Search. "Public companies are using equity to entice new security leaders and to retain them, privately held companies similarly leverage equity-rich packages to preserve EBITDA." At the other end of the scale is education, where average base pay is $243,000, while hospitals and clinics come in at $334,000. For the first time this category had to be split from the rest of the healthcare industry, because the disparities are so wide – $465,000 was the average for pharma and medical insurers. Another trick to boost compensation is to go back to the office – at least part-time. The survey found that hybrid or office workers got more than a 6 percent increase in their pay last year. One in five remote workers saw their pay packet stay the same last year, and 45 percent got a less than 5 percent increase. The rich are also getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. Among the top 10 percent of best-paid CISOs, 23 percent saw their pay rise by over 20 percent. Among the 25 percent of the lowest-paid CISOs, two thirds said their compensation hadn't changed, or had risen less than five percent. And as with most jobs in the US, it also matters where you work, Kakolowski opined. California tops the pay scales, unsurprisingly, and CISOs are more than twice as likely to get some form of equity – reflecting the startup culture on the West Coast. The North East is the second most lucrative place to work, but outside of these two the South East was the most rewarding. Kakolowski cited the financial services groupings around North Carolina, the thriving biotech scene, and Texas's burgeoning tech sector. Canadian CISOs reported the lowest earnings, but at least they have cheap healthcare to make up for it. ® Get our Tech Resources Share More about CISO Employment IT Governance More like these × More about CISO Employment IT Governance Narrower topics Employment Tribunal Freelancing Job cuts Layoff Trade Union Umbrella Firm Working from Home Broader topics Security More about Share 12 COMMENTS More about CISO Employment IT Governance More like these × More about CISO Employment IT Governance Narrower topics Employment Tribunal Freelancing Job cuts Layoff Trade Union Umbrella Firm Working from Home Broader topics Security TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Why send a message when you can get your Zoom digital video clone to read the script?

Youth Sports Were Already IntenseâNow AI Tools Are Supercharging the Competition Skip to content By Todd Feathers Published October 4, 2024 | Comments ( 40 ) | ð Copied! Â© Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE/AFP via Getty Images Ashley Brown used to watch her daughterâs club volleyball games through the screen of her phone, afraid to put it down and miss out on footage of a set or kill that would catch the eye of a college recruiter. And as the coach of her daughterâs high school volleyball team in Caledonia, Michigan, Brownâs attention was constantly split between watching the games and tallying each playerâs statistics by hand. But this year, her daughterâs traveling club team purchased an artificial intelligence service called Balltime for all players aged 12 to 18. A single phone or tablet placed behind the courtâs endline records a game and uploads it to the companyâs platform, which uses body and object recognition algorithms to track each player so that their every ball contact and movement on the court can be cataloged and datafied. By the time a player has gotten home from a game and showered, the service can prepare personalized stat reports and social media-ready highlight packages. It also gives coaches a bevy of data that was previously only available to professional and elite college volleyball programs. Balltime automatically measures how high in the air players make contact with the ball, their kill and error percentages, ball trajectories, serve speeds, and which rotations of players score the most. Itâs part of a growing sports technology industry selling computer vision algorithms, wearable biometric sensors, and predictive analytics services to youth clubs and high school athletics departments, opening up a new world of video and data analysis thatâfor better or worseâis changing the way young athletes and their families experience sports. Without needing to spend hours cutting together videos themselves, teams can gather comprehensive video evidence to show, rather than tell, young players what they did right and wrong. And coaches and college recruiters say platforms like Balltime and Darkhorse AI , which provides a similar player-tracking service for soccer, are allowing them to make more data-driven decisions about rosters and playing time. âIt has helped me already this season with some of the difficult conversations I’ve had to have with players and parents,â Brown said. â[I can tell them] it’s not because I don’t like your kid, this is a computer system and software system that are rating these things based on these parameters.â As valuable as they can be to help players learn and improve, some coaches worry the data and highlight packages produced by AI analytics services also supercharge unhealthy competition among young athletes vying for attention from recruiters and on social media. âThereâs this mad rush right now to use these tools to self promote and thereâs this pit of loneliness that can happen when you donât get that attention,â said Ben Bahr, a former college coach and data analyst who now works as director of coaching for Adrenaline Volleyball in Iowa, which uses Balltime. âWith the rise of AI and sharing of data, the thing thatâs come out of this the most is that itâs become much easier to compare yourself with what someone else is doing.â Big money in young sports The push for advanced data analytics is part of the growing monetization of childrenâs sports. A report frequently cited by sports technology investors estimates that the youth sports market had a global value of $37.5 billion in 2022 that will grow to $69.4 billion by 2030, rivaling some of the worldâs most popular professional leagues. Private equity firms have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy youth sports complexes and teenagers are now competing not just for spots on college rosters but also for life-changing money from name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, thanks to a 2021 Supreme Court case that opened the door to private sponsorships for college athletes. âThere is definitely a downward move toward more professionalized youth sports,â Dan Banon, Balltimeâs CEO, told Gizmodo. He and chief technology officer Tom Raz began building the platform with adults in mind but soon realized the biggest potential for growth was in traveling club teams and high schools. Over the past year, he said, the company has seen more signups from junior varsity teams and even middle school programs. Their data shows that some players spend seven hours a month reviewing footage on Balltime. At $25 per month for a player, Balltimeâs recruiting package isnât for everyone. But with the average household spending $883 a year on a single childâs primary sport, according to a parent survey from the Aspen Instituteâs Project Play, the additional cost is also well within many familiesâ sports budgets. Responding to pressure from families who want their children to have every advantage, some elite clubs are looking for even more ways to combine, collect, and analyze player data. Mustang Soccer League, based in Danville, California is in the process of building out a data analytics department and some players can expect to spend an additional $250 a year on technology subscriptions, said Fred Wilson, the clubâs executive director. Mustang recently introduced Darkhorse AI for its 12 to 18-year-old teams and is beginning to discuss high-level analytics with players as young as 10. Like Balltime, Darkhorse uses object recognition algorithms to track players during games, automatically cataloging various stats and curating highlight reels. Some Mustang teams also link that information with biometric data like heart rate and running speed captured by Beyond Pulse wearable sensors. âI donât know how much learning weâre going to do with 10-year-olds, but Iâm trying to instill a habit so that when theyâre 14 or 15 theyâre paying attention to these things â¦ make it just second nature for players to understand,â Wilson said. The club boasts several former players who are now professionals and dozens more at top college programs. âThis whole AI piece takes us to that next level to be able to do that,â Wilson said. âI take 200 calls a year [from sports technology vendors] to find the gem.â Most of them are âout trying to make a quick buck,â he added, but some are offering real value. Karin Pfeiffer, director of the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan State University, said that even at the college level, where wearable biometric sensors and data analytics have been common for some time, programs are still struggling to figure out what data is actually useful for athletes and coaches. âCollegiate level coaches are approached all the time with these technology things, I imagine thatâs going to bleed down to high school too if it hasnât already,â she said. âYou can get so much information out of it, but the question is whatâs relevant, whatâs actually tied to performance, whatâs tied to future success.â âInsane pressureâ to hit metrics Coaches and company executives told Gizmodo that the biggest driver of the AI analytics boom in youth sports is the prospect that the tools can help athletes make the jump to college, where a spot on a roster can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in scholarships and, at the highest levels, hundreds of thousands of dollars in sponsorship deals. Some products, like SwimIntel, focus purely on recruiting rather than coaching. The platform collects competition data on swimmers as young as 15 and uses it to rank them as recruits and train models that predict how they will fare in different collegiate swim programs. For $40 a month, swimmers can receive 60-plus page analytics reports that project how their times will improve, or worsen, at different colleges. Schools that contract with SwimIntel receive similar predictions in reverse based on how other athletes from the same youth swim club have performed once in college. âWe let college coaches play moneyball using AI,â said Jamie Bailey, the founder of SwimIntel. âWe let student athletes use AI to find best fits. And in the end, what we’re trying to do is reduce that dropout rate. One out of six college swimmers don’t come back their sophomore year.â Bahr, the former college volleyball coach and data analyst, said that when he worked at programs like Baylor University and Southern Methodist University the volleyball staff would sometimes receive 600 emails a day from prospective recruits. If a player didnât catch the recruiterâs eye in the first 30 seconds of their highlight reel, they were often passed over. Now with Balltime, more players have access to more video footage than they ever had before and the measurement algorithms have changed the way college programs assess highlight reels. âI donât even need to watch the film,â Bahr said, recruiters can just look at Balltimeâs video analytics to see âare you touching the ball at a height thatâs at a better height than our competition? Are you touching the ball over 10 feet or not? Weâre already in this insane pressure of hitting these metrics and these tools certainly havenât helped with thatâ At the same time, several coaches who spoke to Gizmodo were optimistic that AI video tools will also increase competition in a positive wayâby allowing athletes who donât play for the biggest youth teams to improve their skills and get noticed by recruiters. âHaving that video, having those stats, those are real educational tools,â said Pfeiffer, from Michigan State University. âIt all comes down to how the athlete is receiving that and making sure appropriate supports are in place. I donât think these things should be unchecked, they should come with guidance from parents and coaches. But sometimes parents and coaches are overzealousâ Ai Balltime Darkhorse AI Sports Daily Newsletter Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The S&P 500 is almost never this expensive. It’s a disaster waiting to happen. Read full article Brett Arends Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 5:30 PM 6 min read Link Copied 11 In this article: The S&P 500 is teetering on the edge. - ©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection Nothing says we’re teetering on the brink of World War III quite like a U.S. stock market that’s even more expensive, in relation to its underlying fundamentals, than it was at the peak in 1929. The issue isn’t just the terrifying situation in the Middle East, either. The U.S. economy is also slowing, the Federal Reserve just slashed interest rates, and we face a pivotal presidential election. Oh, and China, the world’s second-largest economy, is stumbling . Most Read from MarketWatch ‘I’m scared to death’: My wife asked for a divorce after 21 years. She wants to buy a house with our savings, but promises to help pay my mortgage. ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? The S&P 500 is too tech-heavy. This alternative ETF keeps beating it. ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? Yet the S&P 500 SPX index, which is the cornerstone of almost every reader’s 401(k), IRA and other retirement accounts, currently sells for a higher multiple of average earnings than at almost any time in history. The so-called cyclically adjusted or Shiller price-to-earnings ratio , named after Nobel Prize winner and Yale finance professor Robert Shiller, is currently 35. This ratio compares stock prices to the average corporate earnings of the past decade, adjusted for inflation. Shiller was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics for showing how it had been a powerful predictor of future investment returns. The current ratio is higher than the peak in 1929 (when it hit 33), let alone the late 1960s (when it was just 22). Both proved terrible times for investors. Actually, on this measure, the S&P 500 has only been more expensive on two occasions before this summer: During the Greatest Bubble in History from 1998 to 2001, and during the post-COVID mania of 2021-22. Both also proved bad times to be an investor. Check out this chart from Mindful Advisory, a money-management firm in New Jersey. Using Shiller’s own data, it tracks all the monthly cyclically adjusted PE ratios since 1881 from the cheapest (bottom left) to the most expensive (top right). - As Shaggy used to say on Scooby-Doo: Yikes! This isn’t an isolated indicator, either. Warren Buffett used to say his favorite measure was to compare the market value of all U.S. stocks to the U.S. annual gross domestic product. Story continues By this, too, we are up in the clouds. Stocks are currently valued at 190% of U.S. GDP . That’s about twice the average since the 1970s. Or consider the measure known as the Tobin’s Q, coined by economist James Tobin (another Nobel laureate), which compared the market value of U.S. stocks to the supposed cost of rebuilding all these companies’ assets from scratch. It, too, is at all-time record levels and about twice its historic average . The usual riposte from Wall Street bulls goes along the lines of, “Bears have been saying that for years, and they’ve been wrong and missed out on massive gains.” They’re absolutely right. But their argument risks double-counting. On the one hand, the higher the stock market goes, the bigger its recent historic returns. Yet on the other, by definition, the higher it goes, the lower its future returns. The argument also ignores risks as well as potential returns. The problem for us ordinary investors isn’t that the S&P 500 is definitely going to collapse, or crash, or even that it will necessarily produce terrible returns over the next five or 10 years. It’s that, as the Bard of Broadway, Damon Runyon, once said, while the race isn’t always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, “that’s the way the smart money bets.” How much do you want to bet on this asset class, at these odds? Mark Cecchini, a certified financial planner in Lehigh Valley, Pa., summed up the situation pretty well in a recent tweet. The “recency bias right now is so strong that no one thinks about the lost decades of the S&P,” he wrote. “From 2000 to 2010, the annualized return of the S&P was -0.97% … Personally I’m not willing to bet the probability of achieving my family’s goals on 1 asset class dominated by 7 companies.” No kidding. Those seven companies — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA, Google/Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Facebook/Meta META, and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B — account for about a third of the entire S&P 500 by value and, even crazier, about one-sixth of all the listed stocks in the world. At these levels, the S&P 500 seems to have priced in little margin for risk at a time when risks seem even higher than usual. The chances that it will produce terrific returns from here over the next decade must logically be slimmer than they have been. And they are probably slimmer than most investors think. Vanguard recently reported that U.S. investors’ expectations are now at their highest levels since it began surveying back in 2017. And the expectations are higher than even Vanguard’s own forecasts. Ben Inker, the co-head of asset allocation at white-shoe Boston fund firm GMO, warns in a new research paper that “lost decades” for U.S. investors — long periods of about 10 years when you earn nothing — have been more common than we may think. Inker was writing not only about the stock market but about the so-called “balanced” or “60/40” portfolio, consisting of 60% in the S&P 500 and 40% in the U.S. bond market. Since 1900, Inker writes, “there have been six periods, averaging 11 years each, in which an investor in a 60/40 portfolio would have either broken even relative to inflation or, even worse, lost money in real terms.” Everyone will have their own thoughts. Many investors, buoyed by years of a booming S&P 500 and this year’s rally in bonds, will ignore the warnings and just stick with 60/40. Institutions will pin their faith in “alternatives,” typically meaning high-fee entities like hedge funds and private equity. (Those are brilliant wealth creators for the people who run them. Not so much for their investors.) Doug Ramsey at investment group Leuthold Group models an “All Asset No Authority” portfolio that has done as well as 60/40 since the early 1970s, but with no lost decades: It includes U.S. small-caps IWM, developed international stocks VEA, gold SGOL, commodities GSG and REITs VNQ, as well as the S&P 500 SPY and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds IEF. My own preferences include U.S. and international small-company stocks, which seem to have missed out on the S&P 500 mania; resource stocks, which seem to march to a different beat to the rest of the market ; and inflation-protected Treasury bonds. Make of that what you will. It’s your money and your choice. If the S&P 500 goes vertical from here, you can have a good laugh at my expense. I don’t mind interesting times. I just expect stocks to be cheaper than they are now when I encounter them.

I’m a founder, writer and lecturer focusing on VC funds. Following Oct 3, 2024, 01:20pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Flora Fertility, heyflora.co Flora Fertility Reproductive health and family planning are becoming the forefront of social discourse, and a promising InsurTech startup just closed a fresh $1.5M pre-seed funding round - led by Highline Beta with co-investment by Cartography Capital and Everywhere Ventures - bringing them a step closer to transforming the landscape of fertility coverage. Flora , co-founded by Laura McDonald and Dr. Christy Lane, is introducing the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy, aiming to bridge the significant gap in fertility treatment funding. The Fertility Market: A Landscape of Investments and Challenges The fertility market has been a hotbed for private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments in recent years. Dr. Christy Lane , one of Flora’s Co-Founder, observes, "We're seeing clinic roll-ups, particularly in the US, where PE is going in and rolling up those clinics. In some cases, it's a good thing where you're seeing better services, better access to care." However, despite these investments and advancements in fertility science, a critical issue persists: the funding gap for fertility treatments. According to the World Health Organization, infertility is a global health issue, affecting one in six to one in five people who may need some form of fertility treatment. Laura McDonald , Flora’s Co-founder, explains "Depending on where you are, 60 to 80% of people still have no coverage through their work or health plans, or limited coverage." This lack of coverage is particularly pronounced for individuals working in small to medium-sized businesses or those who are self-employed. Flora's Solution: Individually-Owned Fertility Insurance Flora's innovative approach centers on creating the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy. Lane elaborates, "We've spent decades really understanding the clinical research and the claims patterns for infertility treatment. That's what's allowed us to be able to develop these individual risk underwriting models and actuarial or pricing models." MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor This individual risk model sets Flora apart from traditional group insurance plans, which don't perform individual underwriting. As a result, Flora can provide more affordable coverage for individuals and small groups, a market segment previously underserved by existing fertility coverage options. Target Demographics and Market Potential Flora is initially targeting women aged 20 to 34, a demographic increasingly concerned about their future fertility. Lane shares a striking statistic: "50% of young women are concerned about their future fertility before even trying to conceive." This concern is particularly prevalent among women who are prioritizing career development or other life goals before starting a family. As McDonald notes, "They don't want their biological clock to necessarily dictate their life journey. They want to focus on their career and other things." The Technology Behind Flora Flora's innovative approach extends beyond its insurance model to its technological infrastructure. Lane explains, "What we're building is very unique, even in the InsurTech space, which is called a digital MGA (Managing General Agent)." This digital platform allows for wide distribution through channels such as health apps and small to medium businesses. The company has developed a proprietary underwriting engine that enables real-time quoting and fast coverage approvals. Moreover, the data collected through this process opens up exciting possibilities for AI and machine learning applications. McDonald adds, "There are huge opportunities for AI, large language models in improving our ability to better understand risk, but also enable us to better understand how to help women mitigate their own risk through things like lifestyle changes." Flora's Data-Driven Approach: Merging Wearable Tech and Lifestyle Insights to Revolutionize Fertility Support Dr. Christy Lane brings a wealth of experience to Flora's innovative approach to fertility. With a background that includes founding the Wearable Health Lab at Stanford , Lane has spent years investigating the intricate connections between lifestyle factors and fertility. "Part of our value is our deep understanding of what predicts infertility, particularly lifestyle," Lane explains. Her research has delved into how physical activity, sleep patterns, nutrition, and even data from wearable devices and IoT can impact fertility. This expertise forms the foundation of Flora's unique offering: personalized lifestyle journeys for women. By collecting and analyzing data, Flora aims to provide tailored, non-clinical recommendations to improve natural conception chances. For women already on a fertility journey, the company offers practical advice on sleep optimization, physical activity, and nutrition. Lane emphasizes, "We're not just providing insurance; we're offering a holistic approach to reproductive health." This data-driven, lifestyle-focused strategy sets Flora apart in the fertility market, promising a more comprehensive and personalized approach to family planning. Comprehensive Coverage and Community Support Flora's coverage is designed to be comprehensive, including diagnostics, drugs, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF). But the company's vision extends beyond mere financial coverage. Lane, drawing from her personal experience with fertility treatments, emphasizes the importance of community support: "Part of what we want to do is create community within women who become members of the Flora community and policyholders to make sure that these women understand infertility, understand their potential risks, and also lifestyle changes and things that they can do to reduce their risk of infertility." The company plans to provide personalized lifestyle recommendations to help women improve their chances of conceiving naturally. They're also establishing partnerships with sexual health platforms, menstrual tracking apps, and clinics to create a holistic reproductive health ecosystem. The Alternative to Egg Freezing Flora positions itself as an alternative or an addition to egg freezing, a procedure that has gained popularity but comes with its own set of challenges and uncertainties. McDonald shares an anecdote that encapsulates their value proposition: "This young woman came up to me... She said, 'We're being told that we have to freeze our eggs, that that's our insurance policy for our future fertility. But what you made me realize is that I actually just need an insurance policy, literally, I just need an insurance policy.'" McDonald illustrates the cost-effectiveness of their approach with an example: "My daughter Molly, who plans to go to law school, can freeze her eggs in her 20s for, say $10,000 or she can buy a Flora policy, and depending on the ages she buys it, it might be $20 a month." Overcoming Industry Challenges; why Flora and why now? When addressing the common questions surrounding their fertility insurance product. "Many people ask why this hasn't been done before, and why established insurance companies don't simply adopt our model," McDonald explains. The answer lies in the complex landscape of insurance and the unique challenges of fertility coverage. Traditional insurance relies heavily on established mortality tables and risk models for areas like death, disability, and natural disasters. However, fertility insurance requires the creation of entirely new models. "We've spent over 18 months building out these risk models," McDonald reveals, highlighting the extensive work involved. This process combines decades of expertise from team members like Dr. Christy Lane, who has studied the field for over 20 years, with innovative approaches to data analysis and risk assessment, and Somil Jain, a leading actuary for transformational digital insurance models. McDonald points out that the insurance industry often relies on InsurTech companies like Flora to pioneer such new models and bring innovative products to market. The challenges extend beyond model creation to navigating regulatory environments and securing capacity partners for claim payouts. Despite these hurdles, Flora has succeeded thanks to their team's diverse background and support from partners like InsureTech NY. McDonald emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in finding and utilizing new data sets to create novel underwriting, risk, and pricing models. Additionally, Flora's strategic advantage in distribution positions them to rapidly reach millions of women, increasing their odds of becoming a pioneer in this untapped market of individual fertility insurance. The Future of Fertility Coverage Flora's ambitions extend beyond fertility treatment coverage. The company envisions a long-term model that supports women throughout their reproductive journey and beyond. As McDonald explains, "We can ideally stay with you before the baby, when you have the baby, whether you need treatment or not, and after." Future plans include expanding coverage to areas such as postpartum depression treatment, pelvic floor treatment, and even perimenopause and menopause support. This comprehensive approach aims to address the full spectrum of women's reproductive health needs. Conclusion: A New Paradigm in Reproductive Health Coverage Flora represents a significant shift in how we approach fertility and reproductive health insurance. By offering individually-owned policies based on personalized risk assessments, the company is making fertility treatment more accessible and affordable for a broader demographic. As reproductive health continues to gain prominence in public discourse, innovations like Flora's individually-owned fertility insurance policies may well become a cornerstone of comprehensive healthcare coverage. With its blend of InsurTech innovation, data-driven risk assessment, and community-focused approach - Flora is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of fertility coverage and women's health support. In a world where reproductive autonomy and financial stability often seem at odds, Flora's approach offers a promising solution. By providing women with the financial tools to take control of their fertility journey, Flora is not just selling insurance – it's offering peace of mind and expanded reproductive choices to a generation of women balancing health challenges, emotional and career needs with family planning.

[+] Federal Reserve's Division of Research and Statistics Centennial Conference on November 08, 2023 in Washington, DC. Market watchers and policy makers are listening carefully to Powell for indications of whether the Fed would need to hike rates further to bring down inflation. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Getty Images Winter it seems, across much of Europe, has come early. Two instincts that grow as the evenings darken are the inclination to have a tipple in the evening and to watch a good film. One Danish work that captures both sentiments is ‘Druk’ or ‘Another Round’ , which won the Oscar for best international film in 2021. I recommend it. In the film a group of four school teacher friends decide to test the hypothesis of a Norwegian psychologist that humans have a deficiency of alcohol in their blood, and the protagonists undertake an experiment to maintain a ‘warm’ level of alcohol in their blood. It is an experiment I attempt often, but the real lesson today is with central banking. It seems that central bankers have decided that in the spirit of ‘Druk’, the liquidity in the world financial system is not sufficient and have set out to administer near daily injections of cheap money. The number of central banks changing policy (i.e. to negative) is the greatest it has been, apart from the global financial crisis and the COVID period. In September alone there have been 24 rate cuts from central banks around the world. Chief amongst these has been the 50-basis point cut from the Federal Reserve and the very dramatic, multiple policy moves by China. In short China has cut rates, infused the banking system, made mortgages cheaper and generally tried to spread liquidity over the emerging cracks in China’s economy. In the spirit of ‘Druk’ it is the equivalent of going on a five day bender in order to cure a serious disease. Nonetheless, the easing in policy from the Fed and China, together with what will likely be a couple of more rate cuts this year from the European Central Bank mean that the world financial system is flush with liquidity. Chinese markets – hitherto the worst performing markets of a major economy – show the impact and importance of liquidity. The market cap of the Hang Seng index has grown by a quarter in less than two weeks. China has overtaken the US in terms of equity market performance to date. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor There is no change to fundamentals – I don’t see this policy move having a decisive impact on the downward trend in Chinese earnings, but that doesn’t matter in the near term – liquidity is coursing through the pipes of the Chinese financial system, and in turn might bring a temporary easing to conditions in the property market. For all the analysts who devote time to measuring earnings and calibrating valuations, the reality is that in this era of ‘quick to please’ monetary policy, liquidity matters a lot for asset prices. My rule of thumb in constructing a measure of liquidity would encompass money supply, the state of central bank balance sheets, the key role of the dollar and net issuance of debt by treasuries. The arcane notion of financial liquidity has attracted enough attention that the Financial Times recently ran an article breaking down its component parts. A couple of top-flight economics consultancies run their own measures of liquidity – such as LongView Economics and Michael Howell at CrossBorder Capital. The latter holds that we are on the cusp of a significant upswing in global liquidity. If that is true, the implication for markets is ‘Druk’- a persistent giddyiness whilst central banks keep rates low and liquidity flush, amidst an acceptable level of GDP and profit growth. Friday’s job market figures in the US were very strong, suggesting that in fact there was no need for a large rate cut. This is the kind of macro climate we have seen in the mid and late 1990’s, and one that tends to dampen the market implications of turbulent geopolitics. From the point of view of asset prices, there are a couple of possible trajectories. Historically, the Fed has started to cut interest rates when the price to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has been close to 10 times (1960’s to 1990’s). Now, like in 2000, it is in the mid 20’s which suggests that extra liquidity now could run asset prices in bubble territory proper, and cultivate the next bout of inflation, something the central banks’ bank, the BIS, has warned about (helpfully the BIS has taken a counter view to that of its members ahead of a number of crisis). For the time being, the upturn in liquidity may be most meaningful for capital markets activity and assets in the private economy. They have been in the doldrums. If the ‘Druk’ hypothesis is working we should see a rise in IPO activity into 2025, and intensification in private equity deals and a rise in funding activity (beyond AI firms) in venture. Then, later in 2025, the hangover will arrive. Follow me on LinkedIn . Mike O'Sullivan Following Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades Join The Conversation Comments One Community. Many Voices.

If the bears were forced out of their bets, the rally could get further momentum. “The sharp rally in Chinese ADRs over the past week has been mostly the result of fresh buying rather than short covering,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note this week. “Short covering in individual stocks appears to have played only a modest role in the Chinese equity rally.” The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks 30 Chinese tech companies listed in Hong Kong, has soared more than 45% in less than four weeks, including a record surge in the six days through Wednesday. Alibaba, JD.com and food-delivery company Meituan were among those that had some of their best trading days in years as investors swept up in a buying spree after the Chinese government announced measures to stimulate the troubled domestic economy. The tech gauge climbed on Friday for the seventh in eight days. While short sellers have incurred mark-to-market losses, there hasn’t been a rush to cover bearish bets, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics for S3 wrote in an Oct. 1 report. The short interest for Alibaba, JD.com and Baidu had remained around 2% to 3% of shares available. Should the rally continue, though, expect a “significant amount” of short covering, which will push up stock prices even further, Dusaniwsky warned. “The data is surprising as the magnitude of the bounce will normally cause shorts to be wiped out many times over and forced-covered in a traditional risk monitoring and control framework,” said Han Piow Liew, a fund manager at Maitri Asset Management Pte. “The latest round of stimulus pivot by the Chinese government shows that the leadership has significant zeal and intent to turn things around.” Story continues Chinese tech stocks have had a tough few years. While the nation’s economy weakened, a government crackdown on the sector and fierce e-commerce competition hurt results at the firms that once were market darlings. Also read: PDD’s Status as Top China Growth Stock in Doubt After 30% Drop Short sellers who are holding on to their positions may be doing so because they’re skeptical on the recent rally, according to Sonija Li, an analyst at MIB Securities Hong Kong Ltd. Morningstar Inc.’s Chelsey Tam notes that consumers’ “downtrading trend” is still pronounced in sectors including e-commerce, travel and food delivery. Still, when it comes to the options market, bulls are alive and well. Bets for gains on a US exchange-traded fund tracking China’s large-cap stocks are near their priciest ever relative to bearish wagers after record call trading. Alibaba’s and JD.com — companies that have seen a burst of bullish options trading recently — are among its biggest components. Top Tech Stories OpenAI’s Sam Altman is concentrating power on the path to a $157 billion valuation. Cisco Systems Inc. agreed to invest in CoreWeave, a cloud-computing provider that’s among the hottest startups in artificial intelligence, as part of a transaction that values the company at $23 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter. An Australian judge rejected an attempt by social media platform X to wipe a A$610,500 ($418,100) fine levied by a watchdog, a notable victory in the country’s battle with global internet companies. Direxion Funds has launched two exchange-traded products that focus on a single emerging-market stock — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — allowing investors to make outsized bullish bets on it or take positions against the direction of the market.

Advice on Navigating Equity and Inclusion in the AI Era Including DEI experts in brand strategy planning creates a goal everyone can benefit from in the workplace. DrAfter123/Getty Images By Karen Baker Drive business and brand growth with winning media strategies at Mediaweek . Hear from experts at TIME , Peloton , YouTube , Google and more, October 29-30 in New York City. Register . While AI is our latest fascination, upholding and prioritizing equity and inclusion in marketing and advertising is crucial. At Cannes Lions 2024, AI ignited essential and overdue discussions about the future of ad agencies and the creative industry. These conversations must highlight the ongoing need to promote diversity as we grow. As we plan our short- and long-term goals, it is vital to implement equitable and inclusive AI strategies proactively. As marketing and ad agencies evolve with AI, equity and inclusion must remain central. This approach is essential to adapting to the rapid advancements in AI technology and market growth. Adweek Podcast: Design Justice Can Help Brands Create More Considerate, Inclusive Work Strategic preparation and inclusive integration While many were initially pessimistic about AI (some still are), companies must now recognize the need to prepare for its growth. If preparation meets opportunity, let’s get ready. As agencies assess their role and responsibility in this opportunity, addressing ethics in using AI tools must be at the top. Here are three points to think about as you prepare to integrate. Set aside the pessimism. Create a strategic plan to integrate AI into your organization to deliver services more effectively through an inclusion lens. Sitting back and not beginning to plan for the integration can be deadly to the organization and your team. Not only is this integration part of the vision, but it will also be part of the future of business for marketing and advertising. Be forward-thinking. A 2023 McKinsey & Company article called for organizations to have “a mix of DEI experts, business leaders, and change champions who are passionate about improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workplaces.” Diversify your strategy team to include DEI experts and thought leaders who understand how AI can enhance company culture to drive further innovation and robust performance. This is the time to be bold. Including DEI experts in your strategy planning creates a goal everyone can benefit from in your workplace. Keep your finger on the pulse. Remaining aggressive in addressing the problems and obstacles related to equity and inclusion offers better creative decision-making in developing public campaigns. Under the current social landscape, it is a priority to take note of what is happening with your client’s audience and be ahead of the noise. Lessons from past technological missteps In this political and social economic climate, we cannot afford to forget the same historical errors seen and done by other technological innovations—social media, Web 2.0, and the metaverse over the last decade. Designing a strategic plan that includes AI requires a commitment to continuous employee learning and adaptation. Ethical DEI initiatives can foster innovation and a culture of collaboration as agencies provide equal learning opportunities. Here are three points to think about as you map out your strategy. Identify areas within your company culture where employees can achieve professional growth. Getting directly from your employees their strengths and areas for growth early in the hiring process benefits the company, not just the employee. It prevents dollars and hours from being spent on employees being placed in a workplace where they never felt they belonged and could excel. In the assessment, you must address unconscious bias to ensure accessibility and belonging are at the center. Invest in training your teams to understand and ethically leverage AI tools. Once you truly understand an employee’s strengths and how they will embrace AI, agencies can begin to be ahead of the curve and stay there. Foster an ethical culture of innovation. Encourage employees to experiment with AI applications and share their findings. Just like the introduction of computers and the internet, humans love experiential opportunities. So when ChatGPT becomes the fastest-growing user application in history, we know more will come. However, several communities still need access to AI education. Building AI creative-ready workforce DEI is not just the absence of cultural representation; it’s the absence of equitable access. According to Forbes , the boom of the creative economy isn’t offering most countries financial gain. Yet, U.S.-disadvantaged businesses, such as micro- and small agencies, are accessing more AI tools for content creation and ad campaigns than ever. Brands, marketers, and advertisers must value the creative impact in the evolving AI space because every room isn’t created inclusive. Here’s what to keep in mind when fostering inclusivity in AI: A concerted effort to create a more equitable industry environment is necessary—a principle and practice of Design Justice . Being mindful of limiting access to prestigious events like Cannes must be considered. Focus on the significant impacts of knowledge creation, production, and transfer. Be conscious of who benefits now from building an AI creative-ready workforce and be part of changing this outcome. Web3 Doesn’t Have the Traditional Barriers of Web2. Let’s Keep It That Way As we navigate the AI-driven transformation of agencies and the industry, we must balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and inclusive practices. We can cultivate a more innovative but fair environment by fostering equity and inclusion and ensuring equitable access to AI tools and opportunities. Let’s harness the full potential of AI while safeguarding the human essence of creativity, ensuring a vibrant and equitable future for the creative industry.

Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Shell plc (LON:SHEL)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 7:12 AM 4 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: With its stock down 10% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Shell (LON:SHEL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Shell's ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Shell How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Shell is: 10% = US$19b ÷ US$187b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every £1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of £0.10. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Shell's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE To begin with, Shell seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 8.7%. This probably goes some way in explaining Shell's significant 28% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. As a next step, we compared Shell's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 26% in the same period. past-earnings-growth The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SHEL worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether SHEL is currently mispriced by the market. Story continues Is Shell Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Shell's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 35%, meaning the company retains 65% of its income. So it seems that Shell is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered. Additionally, Shell has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 36%. Still, forecasts suggest that Shell's future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much. Summary Overall, we are quite pleased with Shell's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

The CMOs of legacy financial services brands have long relied on a market dominated by older customers. Today, Generation Z and Y (Millennials) make up 42% of the population and 59% of the workforce in the US – but only command 11% of the investment assets ($21T). By comparison older generations (Baby Boomers and The Silent Generation) command 62% of investment assets ($97T) and have largely left the workforce (only 6% are working). Revenue Enablement Institute This concentration of wealth with older customers has led to marketing strategies, channels, and budgets in the financial services industry that are heavily skewed to the high and ultra-high net worth market segments. “The industry has followed the money, and until now there has been a lot more money with older investors,” says David Master who has held marketing executive roles at Janus Henderson, Legg Mason, Prudential Financial, and Chase Manhattan Bank over the last 30 years. But those strategies will not work going forward as industry demand pivots from older clients to younger customers who don’t fully trust legacy financial brands, use different channels to communicate, and have very different ideas about investing, borrowing, and making payments. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor These new generations are already reshaping the market, and rules of engagement, across every aspect of financial services – from banking to insurance to investments and payments. Today 60% of Millennials are actively considering insurance, investments, and mortgages. In investments, millennials will increasingly dictate how workplace investments are allocated they will soon comprise three-quarters of the global workforce, according to EY’s Global Generations Research . In lending, Millennials are the highest driver of net new loan demand today, according to a study by Morgan Stanley . Building brand equity and trust with Gen Z customers will matter as these younger borrowers are forecast to account for one third of all consumer debt by 2040. The elephant in the room is the fact that $84 Trillion of assets currently held by older clients are going to be transferred to a younger generation in the Great Wealth Transfer next ten years - which only exacerbates the problem of finding better ways to market Financial Services To The Next Generation. The art of building brands, trust and relationships with these 142 million younger customers will be very different. I recently hosted a panel of marketing leaders from JPM Chase, Credit Karma, and North Avenue Capital where we talked about the challenges and opportunities that marketers face as they try to bridge the generational gap in terms of building trust, adapting communication channels, generating effective content, and innovating. These industry veterans emphasized that brands need to adapt their offerings, innovations, content, channel strategies, and value propositions to differentiate their offerings in the eyes of younger buyers if they are to succeed. “Since our founding, we’ve worked hard to learn ways to understand and engage millennials and now we’re figuring out ways to engage and differentiate our services with even younger Gen Z buyers who are different in terms of their role, behavior and preferences,” says Kaitlyn Crowder , Vice President, Marketing Director, North Avenue Capital in our webinar conversation . “One strategy that has worked is to differentiate with speed. In a lending sector that is inherently commoditized, we’ve been able to use speed to close as a differentiator. And we’ve focused on building the trust with consumers by backing that promise up by demonstrating ways we ‘walk the talk’ in everything we do when we engage the customer – from providing real time updates, on time follow up, timely response and communications.” “From an innovation perspective, we are a leading bank competing in a rapidly changing payments landscape, marketing to new non-traditional buyers,” says Abel Flint, VP, Growth & Creative Strategy at J.P. Morgan Payments . “We’ve been effective at authentically emphasizing our strengths and differentiators. We offer ‘fintech with foundations’ which emphasizes both our innovation and also our reliability, stability, and scale. We’re an established bank and also a technology- and data-driven company.” The bank has invested $17 billion firmwide on technology and operate globally at unparalleled scale and speed . Buyer research suggests Financial Services marketers will also have to serve up a different mix of offerings and asset classes to meet the needs of these younger buyers, which are materially different from older customers they are used to. Having grown up amid the economic uncertainty of 2008 and Covid 19, these younger generations are exploring non-traditional spending strategies like Buy-Now-Pay-Later — a market now worth over $30 Billion — and alternative wealth-building methods like fractional housing investments, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies, according to WHY Report trends research by Horizon Catalyst. Most (72%) younger investors, ages 21 – 43, believe they have to look beyond traditional stocks and bonds to achieve above average investment returns, according to the 2024 Study of Wealthy Americans by BofA. That’s twice as many as their older counterparts (over 44 years old) who feel the same way. For example, 21-43 year olds are seven times more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets than Baby Boomers according to the same study. They are also twice as likely to be interested in investing in art and collectables than older investors. Perhaps the biggest change will be the evolving mix of paid, earned, owned and shared channels marketers must use to “break through the clutter” to effectively engage, educate and activate relationships with these younger buyers. “From a go-to-market perspective, you have to experiment with new and non-traditional channels to meet the customer where they are,” according to Emily Childers in our webinar conversation . Emily heads Growth Marketing at Credit Karma – a personal finance company that engages 140 million Americans – half of whom are Millennials - in their marketplace to help them manage and optimize their finances. “To do that you will have to go to new places and constantly experiment. We are constantly changing the mix of owned, earned, paid, and shared channels to achieve a 360-degree view of the customer and looking for new channels and technologies that can give us first mover advantage,” adds Childers. Younger buyers have to be engaged differently because they are ‘digital natives’ born into an era of technological innovation. They grew up with smartphones, gaming, and social media as the norm - while Gen Z and Boomer customers had to react and adapt to digital channels. This means marketers must engage brands through a wider combination of channels – ranging from search, television, events, and email to OTT platforms, influencers, livestreaming, social commerce, and games. In particular, social media has become an increasingly important channel to reach younger customers. Over three quarters of Gen Z and Millennials feel comfortable purchasing on social media, according to research by the WHY Group . Younger Gen Z consumers are especially active on social media channels. For example, 80% of them spend time on the YouTube platform, 75% on Instagram, and 69% on TikTok. Half of them spend at least four hours a day on these platforms, according to a survey of 1,002 consumers ages 13 to 26, by Morning Consult Research Intelligence. The amount of time and attention they spend on these platforms is forcing marketers to raise the bar on the quality of their content, rethink their allocation of paid media relative to earned and shared media, and rework their attribution models. In particular, these new channels are changing the way marketers plan, create, deploy and leverage content, creative and messaging. “Today marketers need to be transitioning to content, messaging, and channels that appeal more to a younger audience. And that will look different in terms of being in shorter form, ‘social ready’, video, and in tune with their individualized interests,” adds David Master who along with Jennifer Ball, the CMO of Franklin Templeton and other leaders in the field, will be speaking about how content has become king in terms of driving sales and client retention in the asset management business. Overcoming bad content – in the form of misinformation is a big opportunity, according to Emily Childers. “Learning from the internet is the disease that this new generation faces. You need to combat it transparent systems, communications, credit scoring and education,” says Childers in our webinar conversation . “We see education is a big opportunity,” adds Kaitlyn Crowder . “In our business, if you are not educating customers you are not reaching them. Particularly with brokers – who are important influencers and channel partners in our business. We’ve had to find a way to educate within the limits of attention span by getting to the point quickly and making videos 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes to address the behavior and expectations of younger audience.” Confounding matters further, younger buyers want honesty, consistency, personalization and privacy all at the same time. For example, both Millennials and Gen Z want honest and transparent communication (97% and 96% respectively) and greater consistency in all their interactions with a company (95% and 93%), according to research by Salesforce . They also demand both personalization and privacy. On one hand over 91% of both Millennials and Gen Z want to be viewed as individuals, not numbers. On the other hand, over 92% want assurances that their customer information is used responsibly, and most would like their financial institution to provide advanced identity and credit protection according to the same study – and nearly half expressed interest in data protection for digital assets, according to a survey of 1,039 consumers by the Financial Brand. This is forcing marketers to change their governance, communication and data strategies. From a relationship standpoint, Financial Services marketers will be challenged to build trust with younger buyers according to the panelists. A Financial Brand study examining Millennial and Gen Z banking buying behaviors revealed that trust and security are top priorities when choosing a financial services provider. With all these constraints, changes and balances to navigate, you’d think markers would become conservative. In fact, the best marketers in the industry are embracing this challenge as an opportunity. “All of these changes, new channels, behaviors and trends make this a great time for marketing to create more value,” says Kaitlyn Crowder , Vice President, Marketing Director, North Avenue Capital in our webinar conversation . “You have to be courageous – and experiment like your life depended on it - because sticking with the status quo in terms of content, media and engagement channels will mean failure,” says Abel Flint of J.P. Morgan Payments . “You cannot let tradition or legacy get in the way of experimenting with new media content, and ways to go to market. As a long-established bank operating in rapidly changing payments landscape – we’ve had to build trust with a new generation of buyers. One avenue is finding ways to tap into the content and channels of publishers, while being authentic, to co-create content with them directly,” adds Flint who will be speaking about ways to make your brand stand out in a saturated and overwhelming multi-channel media environment. I’ll continue this conversation on November 7 th and 8th along with a roster of 45 leading marketing executives from banking, wealth and asset management, insurance and fintech industries speaking about the changing nature of marketing in financial services at the 11 th annual Digital Marketing in Financial Services Summit in NYC.

Advertisement “This credit facility further strengthens our balance sheet and provides flexibility to seize future growth opportunities,” said Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer. “We are proud to have the strongest banks and investors in the world supporting us.” Advertisement Credit facilities are a type of loan agreement that allow borrowers to borrow money without having to reapply for a new loan each time. The new funding comes amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that OpenAI is spending more than it’s making . The company is also reportedly considering restructuring its nonprofit status to attract investors. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly has assured employees, however, that he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. Advertisement OpenAI holds the spot of the third-most valuable private company in the world, behind only TikTok parent ByteDance and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to market research firm CB Insights . A deal allowing employees to sell stakes in the company late last year valued OpenAI at $86 billion . The startup has partnered with a number of the same banks that are providing it with credit facilities to help introduce its Large Language Models (LLM) into their firms.

Goldman Sachs’ generative AI platform also uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models — and others — to support the work of its developers. ChatGPT already has 250 million weekly users, and has driven hype around AI chatbots since its release in November 2022. But its ambitions go farther than gen AI. Advertisement Ultimately, OpenAI is hoping to reach what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI — a futuristic view of machines that can pretty much do anything just as well as humans. In July, the company shared a five-level system it developed to track its progress with employees, with a spokesperson reportedly telling Bloomberg it was already at level two, “Reasoners.” At that threshold, AI can perform basic problem-solving and is on the level of a human with a doctorate degree but no access to tools. 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Advertisement In years to come, Silicon Valley may view the events of the past few weeks as the moment the generative AI boom got too frothy. Investors spent the summer wondering if top AI stocks could continue to justify soaring valuations in the face of absent returns from their massive AI spending. Now, signs have emerged that they're not yet done with generative AI mania. As September rolled into October, some of the most significant investment areas in AI received fresh votes of confidence — be it in the chip space, the large language model arena, and devices. But there could be reason to feel cautious about the latest developments. Advertisement The Nvidia rival with just one main customer Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman is ready to take his company public. Ramsey Cardy Cerebras, a chip startup, included an eyebrow-raising detail in its IPO prospectus . But first, here's a quick primer on the Sunnyvale-based company. Founded in 2015, Cerebras aims to accelerate AI development by designing processors to train and deploy smarter LLMs. It believes these processors, among other offerings, can compete with the powerful chips sold by Nvidia. That's no walk in the park. Nvidia has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, having grown from a market capitalization of $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion. As things stand, however, Cerebras' plan to take it on involves generating the vast majority of its revenue from just one customer: Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. Advertisement According to its IPO prospectus, Cerebras — backed by investment firms such as Altimeter, Benchmark, and Coatue — generated 83% of its $78.6 million revenue in 2023 and 87% of the $136.4 million revenue generated in the first half of 2024 from G42. Founded in 2018, G42 has emerged as one of the Middle East's biggest AI opportunities. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, owns a stake, as do Microsoft and the private equity firm Silver Lake . There appears to be reason to work with G42, then, but by Cerebras' admission, an "adverse" change in the relationship could harm the chip firm. Related stories While Cerebras has sought to strengthen its customer base — it reached an agreement with oil giant Saudi Aramco in September — its revenue concentration will weigh on investors as it aims to raise $1 billion in its public listing at a $7 billion to $8 billion valuation, per Bloomberg. OpenAI reaches dizzying new heights Sam Altman's OpenAI secured a $157 billion valuation after raising $6.6 billion in its latest funding round. NurPhoto/Getty Warning signals emerged elsewhere as OpenAI shook up the market for LLMs on Wednesday by closing the most valuable funding round in Silicon Valley history. Advertisement While the ChatGPT maker announced that it had raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation from a series of new and existing investors, it did so with a few notable asterisks. For one, per the Financial Times , OpenAI has asked its investors not to back its rivals, which include Anthropic, Elon Musk's xAI, and Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the startup founded in June by OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. While it has the right to do this, the ask is unusual in the world of startup investing, where venture capitalists often spread their bets. Gary Marcus, a professor who testified next to OpenAI's Sam Altman at a Congress hearing in 2023, described the move as OpenAI "running scared." David Sacks, general partner at Craft Ventures, called the ask a "shady" one. "The mask is really coming off," he wrote on X. It is also worth taking a closer look at some of the investors in its latest round. As my colleague Darius Rafieyan noted earlier this week , some of the most "prolific bubble chasers" — investors with a track record of betting on companies close to their peak — now count themselves as OpenAI backers. Think SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that burned billions of dollars on WeWork, and Tiger Global, an investment fund that suffered brutal losses in recent years after going on huge startup betting sprees. Advertisement This has taken place against a backdrop of wider challenges. OpenAI no longer has a chief technology officer after Mira Murati quit the firm late last month, becoming the latest top-tier executive to depart. The company has also been battling to reverse its lossmaking operations. According to a September report from The New York Times , OpenAI's monthly revenue grew to $300 million in August —but it has projected $5 billion in losses this year. AI's new form factors get a Meta push Mark Zuckerberg is embedding AI into Meta's new AR glasses, Orion. Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images The other notable sign of market frothiness came as Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a bold new wearable device for the AI era: Meta's Orion. The augmented reality glasses, introduced at the company's Connect conference in late September, put AI front and center by embedding the technology in a way that "can sense and understand the world around you," according to Meta. Advertisement While they have impressed — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave a glowing endorsement of the wearables in a promotional video, and Meta's stock responded positively after the event — there are a few matters to consider beyond the hype for it. The first is cost. According to The Verge's Alex Heath , who spoke to Meta executives, the cost of building a single Orion unit at present is a steep $10,000. Even if that cost can be brought down — something Orion lead Rahul Prasad told The Verge would be a focus of the device's next development phase — Meta will need to contend with the fact that appetite for these wearables hasn't exactly impressed in the past. Meta rival Snapchat took a go at introducing glasses to the market in the mid-2010s but failed to make a splash after incurring a $40 million loss on them . It is taking another crack with AI-embedded eyewear, announcing a partnership last month with OpenAI to embed its tech. Advertisement Other form factors for AI that have emerged recently, such as the Humane AI pin that launched in April and the pocketable rabbit R1 introduced in January, have largely flopped, too. Where does this leave us? In short, a lossmaking startup must justify its $157 billion valuation. A chip firm worth up to $8 billion must persuade investors not to worry about its undiversified revenue streams. Meta will need to convince consumers to switch to another way of interacting with AI entirely. All of these things may come to pass. If so, this will be seen as a juncture where AI goes on to truly revolutionize the industries it touches — and repay the faith of investors. But if history is anything to go by, the high-stakes tech world is rarely plain sailing. Read next Watch: How Twitter panic took down Silicon Valley Bank Tech AI OpenAI More...

Youth Sports Were Already IntenseâNow AI Tools Are Supercharging the Competition Skip to content By Todd Feathers Published October 4, 2024 | Comments ( 40 ) | ð Copied! Â© Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE/AFP via Getty Images Ashley Brown used to watch her daughterâs club volleyball games through the screen of her phone, afraid to put it down and miss out on footage of a set or kill that would catch the eye of a college recruiter. And as the coach of her daughterâs high school volleyball team in Caledonia, Michigan, Brownâs attention was constantly split between watching the games and tallying each playerâs statistics by hand. But this year, her daughterâs traveling club team purchased an artificial intelligence service called Balltime for all players aged 12 to 18. A single phone or tablet placed behind the courtâs endline records a game and uploads it to the companyâs platform, which uses body and object recognition algorithms to track each player so that their every ball contact and movement on the court can be cataloged and datafied. By the time a player has gotten home from a game and showered, the service can prepare personalized stat reports and social media-ready highlight packages. It also gives coaches a bevy of data that was previously only available to professional and elite college volleyball programs. Balltime automatically measures how high in the air players make contact with the ball, their kill and error percentages, ball trajectories, serve speeds, and which rotations of players score the most. Itâs part of a growing sports technology industry selling computer vision algorithms, wearable biometric sensors, and predictive analytics services to youth clubs and high school athletics departments, opening up a new world of video and data analysis thatâfor better or worseâis changing the way young athletes and their families experience sports. Without needing to spend hours cutting together videos themselves, teams can gather comprehensive video evidence to show, rather than tell, young players what they did right and wrong. And coaches and college recruiters say platforms like Balltime and Darkhorse AI , which provides a similar player-tracking service for soccer, are allowing them to make more data-driven decisions about rosters and playing time. âIt has helped me already this season with some of the difficult conversations I’ve had to have with players and parents,â Brown said. â[I can tell them] it’s not because I don’t like your kid, this is a computer system and software system that are rating these things based on these parameters.â As valuable as they can be to help players learn and improve, some coaches worry the data and highlight packages produced by AI analytics services also supercharge unhealthy competition among young athletes vying for attention from recruiters and on social media. âThereâs this mad rush right now to use these tools to self promote and thereâs this pit of loneliness that can happen when you donât get that attention,â said Ben Bahr, a former college coach and data analyst who now works as director of coaching for Adrenaline Volleyball in Iowa, which uses Balltime. âWith the rise of AI and sharing of data, the thing thatâs come out of this the most is that itâs become much easier to compare yourself with what someone else is doing.â Big money in young sports The push for advanced data analytics is part of the growing monetization of childrenâs sports. A report frequently cited by sports technology investors estimates that the youth sports market had a global value of $37.5 billion in 2022 that will grow to $69.4 billion by 2030, rivaling some of the worldâs most popular professional leagues. Private equity firms have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy youth sports complexes and teenagers are now competing not just for spots on college rosters but also for life-changing money from name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, thanks to a 2021 Supreme Court case that opened the door to private sponsorships for college athletes. âThere is definitely a downward move toward more professionalized youth sports,â Dan Banon, Balltimeâs CEO, told Gizmodo. He and chief technology officer Tom Raz began building the platform with adults in mind but soon realized the biggest potential for growth was in traveling club teams and high schools. Over the past year, he said, the company has seen more signups from junior varsity teams and even middle school programs. Their data shows that some players spend seven hours a month reviewing footage on Balltime. At $25 per month for a player, Balltimeâs recruiting package isnât for everyone. But with the average household spending $883 a year on a single childâs primary sport, according to a parent survey from the Aspen Instituteâs Project Play, the additional cost is also well within many familiesâ sports budgets. Responding to pressure from families who want their children to have every advantage, some elite clubs are looking for even more ways to combine, collect, and analyze player data. Mustang Soccer League, based in Danville, California is in the process of building out a data analytics department and some players can expect to spend an additional $250 a year on technology subscriptions, said Fred Wilson, the clubâs executive director. Mustang recently introduced Darkhorse AI for its 12 to 18-year-old teams and is beginning to discuss high-level analytics with players as young as 10. Like Balltime, Darkhorse uses object recognition algorithms to track players during games, automatically cataloging various stats and curating highlight reels. Some Mustang teams also link that information with biometric data like heart rate and running speed captured by Beyond Pulse wearable sensors. âI donât know how much learning weâre going to do with 10-year-olds, but Iâm trying to instill a habit so that when theyâre 14 or 15 theyâre paying attention to these things â¦ make it just second nature for players to understand,â Wilson said. The club boasts several former players who are now professionals and dozens more at top college programs. âThis whole AI piece takes us to that next level to be able to do that,â Wilson said. âI take 200 calls a year [from sports technology vendors] to find the gem.â Most of them are âout trying to make a quick buck,â he added, but some are offering real value. Karin Pfeiffer, director of the Institute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan State University, said that even at the college level, where wearable biometric sensors and data analytics have been common for some time, programs are still struggling to figure out what data is actually useful for athletes and coaches. âCollegiate level coaches are approached all the time with these technology things, I imagine thatâs going to bleed down to high school too if it hasnât already,â she said. âYou can get so much information out of it, but the question is whatâs relevant, whatâs actually tied to performance, whatâs tied to future success.â âInsane pressureâ to hit metrics Coaches and company executives told Gizmodo that the biggest driver of the AI analytics boom in youth sports is the prospect that the tools can help athletes make the jump to college, where a spot on a roster can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in scholarships and, at the highest levels, hundreds of thousands of dollars in sponsorship deals. Some products, like SwimIntel, focus purely on recruiting rather than coaching. The platform collects competition data on swimmers as young as 15 and uses it to rank them as recruits and train models that predict how they will fare in different collegiate swim programs. For $40 a month, swimmers can receive 60-plus page analytics reports that project how their times will improve, or worsen, at different colleges. Schools that contract with SwimIntel receive similar predictions in reverse based on how other athletes from the same youth swim club have performed once in college. âWe let college coaches play moneyball using AI,â said Jamie Bailey, the founder of SwimIntel. âWe let student athletes use AI to find best fits. And in the end, what we’re trying to do is reduce that dropout rate. One out of six college swimmers don’t come back their sophomore year.â Bahr, the former college volleyball coach and data analyst, said that when he worked at programs like Baylor University and Southern Methodist University the volleyball staff would sometimes receive 600 emails a day from prospective recruits. If a player didnât catch the recruiterâs eye in the first 30 seconds of their highlight reel, they were often passed over. Now with Balltime, more players have access to more video footage than they ever had before and the measurement algorithms have changed the way college programs assess highlight reels. âI donât even need to watch the film,â Bahr said, recruiters can just look at Balltimeâs video analytics to see âare you touching the ball at a height thatâs at a better height than our competition? Are you touching the ball over 10 feet or not? Weâre already in this insane pressure of hitting these metrics and these tools certainly havenât helped with thatâ At the same time, several coaches who spoke to Gizmodo were optimistic that AI video tools will also increase competition in a positive wayâby allowing athletes who donât play for the biggest youth teams to improve their skills and get noticed by recruiters. âHaving that video, having those stats, those are real educational tools,â said Pfeiffer, from Michigan State University. âIt all comes down to how the athlete is receiving that and making sure appropriate supports are in place. I donât think these things should be unchecked, they should come with guidance from parents and coaches. But sometimes parents and coaches are overzealousâ Ai Balltime Darkhorse AI Sports Daily Newsletter Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

[+] Federal Reserve's Division of Research and Statistics Centennial Conference on November 08, 2023 in Washington, DC. Market watchers and policy makers are listening carefully to Powell for indications of whether the Fed would need to hike rates further to bring down inflation. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Getty Images Winter it seems, across much of Europe, has come early. Two instincts that grow as the evenings darken are the inclination to have a tipple in the evening and to watch a good film. One Danish work that captures both sentiments is ‘Druk’ or ‘Another Round’ , which won the Oscar for best international film in 2021. I recommend it. In the film a group of four school teacher friends decide to test the hypothesis of a Norwegian psychologist that humans have a deficiency of alcohol in their blood, and the protagonists undertake an experiment to maintain a ‘warm’ level of alcohol in their blood. It is an experiment I attempt often, but the real lesson today is with central banking. It seems that central bankers have decided that in the spirit of ‘Druk’, the liquidity in the world financial system is not sufficient and have set out to administer near daily injections of cheap money. The number of central banks changing policy (i.e. to negative) is the greatest it has been, apart from the global financial crisis and the COVID period. In September alone there have been 24 rate cuts from central banks around the world. Chief amongst these has been the 50-basis point cut from the Federal Reserve and the very dramatic, multiple policy moves by China. In short China has cut rates, infused the banking system, made mortgages cheaper and generally tried to spread liquidity over the emerging cracks in China’s economy. In the spirit of ‘Druk’ it is the equivalent of going on a five day bender in order to cure a serious disease. Nonetheless, the easing in policy from the Fed and China, together with what will likely be a couple of more rate cuts this year from the European Central Bank mean that the world financial system is flush with liquidity. Chinese markets – hitherto the worst performing markets of a major economy – show the impact and importance of liquidity. The market cap of the Hang Seng index has grown by a quarter in less than two weeks. China has overtaken the US in terms of equity market performance to date. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor There is no change to fundamentals – I don’t see this policy move having a decisive impact on the downward trend in Chinese earnings, but that doesn’t matter in the near term – liquidity is coursing through the pipes of the Chinese financial system, and in turn might bring a temporary easing to conditions in the property market. For all the analysts who devote time to measuring earnings and calibrating valuations, the reality is that in this era of ‘quick to please’ monetary policy, liquidity matters a lot for asset prices. My rule of thumb in constructing a measure of liquidity would encompass money supply, the state of central bank balance sheets, the key role of the dollar and net issuance of debt by treasuries. The arcane notion of financial liquidity has attracted enough attention that the Financial Times recently ran an article breaking down its component parts. A couple of top-flight economics consultancies run their own measures of liquidity – such as LongView Economics and Michael Howell at CrossBorder Capital. The latter holds that we are on the cusp of a significant upswing in global liquidity. If that is true, the implication for markets is ‘Druk’- a persistent giddyiness whilst central banks keep rates low and liquidity flush, amidst an acceptable level of GDP and profit growth. Friday’s job market figures in the US were very strong, suggesting that in fact there was no need for a large rate cut. This is the kind of macro climate we have seen in the mid and late 1990’s, and one that tends to dampen the market implications of turbulent geopolitics. From the point of view of asset prices, there are a couple of possible trajectories. Historically, the Fed has started to cut interest rates when the price to earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has been close to 10 times (1960’s to 1990’s). Now, like in 2000, it is in the mid 20’s which suggests that extra liquidity now could run asset prices in bubble territory proper, and cultivate the next bout of inflation, something the central banks’ bank, the BIS, has warned about (helpfully the BIS has taken a counter view to that of its members ahead of a number of crisis). For the time being, the upturn in liquidity may be most meaningful for capital markets activity and assets in the private economy. They have been in the doldrums. If the ‘Druk’ hypothesis is working we should see a rise in IPO activity into 2025, and intensification in private equity deals and a rise in funding activity (beyond AI firms) in venture. Then, later in 2025, the hangover will arrive. Follow me on LinkedIn . Mike O'Sullivan Following Editorial Standards Forbes Accolades Join The Conversation Comments One Community. Many Voices.

Is There An Opportunity With CBIZ, Inc.'s (NYSE:CBZ) 46% Undervaluation? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 1:36 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights CBIZ's estimated fair value is US$120 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$65.37 suggests CBIZ is potentially 46% undervalued When compared to the industry average discount to fair value of 17%, CBIZ's competitors seem to be trading at a lesser discount Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of CBIZ, Inc. ( NYSE:CBZ ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for CBIZ The Method We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$177.0m US$201.0m US$221.5m US$239.0m US$254.1m US$267.2m US$278.8m US$289.4m US$299.3m US$308.6m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Est @ 13.54% Est @ 10.23% Est @ 7.91% Est @ 6.29% Est @ 5.15% Est @ 4.36% Est @ 3.80% Est @ 3.41% Est @ 3.14% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$166 US$177 US$183 US$186 US$186 US$183 US$180 US$175 US$170 US$165 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.8b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%. Story continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$309m× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.5%) = US$7.9b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%) 10 = US$4.2b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.0b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$65.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf Important Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CBIZ as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.966. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for CBIZ Strength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Professional Services industry. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat No apparent threats visible for CBZ. Next Steps: Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Lack of China Tech Short Covering Means Rally Is Fresh Buying Read full article 1 / 3 Lack of China Tech Short Covering Means Rally Is Fresh Buying Sangmi Cha Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 4:56 AM 4 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: (Bloomberg) -- Chinese tech stocks have had a tremendous rally since the nation announced its stimulus spree. And all signs point to fresh buying being the main cause. Most Read from Bloomberg Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Short positions on American Depositary Receipts of major companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. haven’t changed dramatically in recent days, according to S3 Partners and JPMorgan Chase & Co. If the bears were forced out of their bets, the rally could get further momentum. “The sharp rally in Chinese ADRs over the past week has been mostly the result of fresh buying rather than short covering,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note this week. “Short covering in individual stocks appears to have played only a modest role in the Chinese equity rally.” The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks 30 Chinese tech companies listed in Hong Kong, has soared more than 45% in less than four weeks, including a record surge in the six days through Wednesday. Alibaba, JD.com and food-delivery company Meituan were among those that had some of their best trading days in years as investors swept up in a buying spree after the Chinese government announced measures to stimulate the troubled domestic economy. The tech gauge climbed on Friday for the seventh in eight days. While short sellers have incurred mark-to-market losses, there hasn’t been a rush to cover bearish bets, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics for S3 wrote in an Oct. 1 report. The short interest for Alibaba, JD.com and Baidu had remained around 2% to 3% of shares available. Should the rally continue, though, expect a “significant amount” of short covering, which will push up stock prices even further, Dusaniwsky warned. “The data is surprising as the magnitude of the bounce will normally cause shorts to be wiped out many times over and forced-covered in a traditional risk monitoring and control framework,” said Han Piow Liew, a fund manager at Maitri Asset Management Pte. “The latest round of stimulus pivot by the Chinese government shows that the leadership has significant zeal and intent to turn things around.” Story continues Chinese tech stocks have had a tough few years.

Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Shell plc (LON:SHEL)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 7:12 AM 4 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: With its stock down 10% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Shell (LON:SHEL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Shell's ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Shell How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Shell is: 10% = US$19b ÷ US$187b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every £1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of £0.10. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Shell's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE To begin with, Shell seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 8.7%. This probably goes some way in explaining Shell's significant 28% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. As a next step, we compared Shell's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 26% in the same period. past-earnings-growth The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SHEL worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether SHEL is currently mispriced by the market. Story continues Is Shell Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Shell's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 35%, meaning the company retains 65% of its income. So it seems that Shell is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered. Additionally, Shell has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 36%. Still, forecasts suggest that Shell's future ROE will rise to 12% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much. Summary Overall, we are quite pleased with Shell's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Following Oct 4, 2024, 12:20am EDT Updated Oct 11, 2024, 01:07pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Stephen Diorio Bridging The Trust, Innovation, Channel, and Content Gap Financial services marketers are facing a demographic cliff as the market pivots from older legacy clients to younger customers. 142 million tech-savvy and mobile-first Millennial and Generation Z consumers are poised to redefine what digital marketing means in the financial services industry by demanding more innovation, more meaningful experiences and more brand trust than traditional older and wealthier customers. The CMOs of legacy financial services brands have long relied on a market dominated by older customers. Today, Generation Z and Y (Millennials) make up 42% of the population and 59% of the workforce in the US – but only command 11% of the investment assets ($21T). By comparison older generations (Baby Boomers and The Silent Generation) command 62% of investment assets ($97T) and have largely left the workforce (only 6% are working). Revenue Enablement Institute This concentration of wealth with older customers has led to marketing strategies, channels, and budgets in the financial services industry that are heavily skewed to the high and ultra-high net worth market segments. “The industry has followed the money, and until now there has been a lot more money with older investors,” says David Master who has held marketing executive roles at Janus Henderson, Legg Mason, Prudential Financial, and Chase Manhattan Bank over the last 30 years. But those strategies will not work going forward as industry demand pivots from older clients to younger customers who don’t fully trust legacy financial brands, use different channels to communicate, and have very different ideas about investing, borrowing, and making payments. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor These new generations are already reshaping the market, and rules of engagement, across every aspect of financial services – from banking to insurance to investments and payments. Today 60% of Millennials are actively considering insurance, investments, and mortgages. In investments, millennials will increasingly dictate how workplace investments are allocated they will soon comprise three-quarters of the global workforce, according to EY’s Global Generations Research . In lending, Millennials are the highest driver of net new loan demand today, according to a study by Morgan Stanley . Building brand equity and trust with Gen Z customers will matter as these younger borrowers are forecast to account for one third of all consumer debt by 2040. The elephant in the room is the fact that $84 Trillion of assets currently held by older clients are going to be transferred to a younger generation in the Great Wealth Transfer next ten years - which only exacerbates the problem of finding better ways to market Financial Services To The Next Generation. The art of building brands, trust and relationships with these 142 million younger customers will be very different. I recently hosted a panel of marketing leaders from JPM Chase, Credit Karma, and North Avenue Capital where we talked about the challenges and opportunities that marketers face as they try to bridge the generational gap in terms of building trust, adapting communication channels, generating effective content, and innovating. These industry veterans emphasized that brands need to adapt their offerings, innovations, content, channel strategies, and value propositions to differentiate their offerings in the eyes of younger buyers if they are to succeed. “Since our founding, we’ve worked hard to learn ways to understand and engage millennials and now we’re figuring out ways to engage and differentiate our services with even younger Gen Z buyers who are different in terms of their role, behavior and preferences,” says Kaitlyn Crowder , Vice President, Marketing Director, North Avenue Capital in our webinar conversation . “One strategy that has worked is to differentiate with speed. In a lending sector that is inherently commoditized, we’ve been able to use speed to close as a differentiator. And we’ve focused on building the trust with consumers by backing that promise up by demonstrating ways we ‘walk the talk’ in everything we do when we engage the customer – from providing real time updates, on time follow up, timely response and communications.” “From an innovation perspective, we are a leading bank competing in a rapidly changing payments landscape, marketing to new non-traditional buyers,” says Abel Flint, VP, Growth & Creative Strategy at J.P. Morgan Payments . “We’ve been effective at authentically emphasizing our strengths and differentiators. We offer ‘fintech with foundations’ which emphasizes both our innovation and also our reliability, stability, and scale. We’re an established bank and also a technology- and data-driven company.” The bank has invested $17 billion firmwide on technology and operate globally at unparalleled scale and speed . Buyer research suggests Financial Services marketers will also have to serve up a different mix of offerings and asset classes to meet the needs of these younger buyers, which are materially different from older customers they are used to. Having grown up amid the economic uncertainty of 2008 and Covid 19, these younger generations are exploring non-traditional spending strategies like Buy-Now-Pay-Later — a market now worth over $30 Billion — and alternative wealth-building methods like fractional housing investments, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies, according to WHY Report trends research by Horizon Catalyst. Most (72%) younger investors, ages 21 – 43, believe they have to look beyond traditional stocks and bonds to achieve above average investment returns, according to the 2024 Study of Wealthy Americans by BofA. That’s twice as many as their older counterparts (over 44 years old) who feel the same way. For example, 21-43 year olds are seven times more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets than Baby Boomers according to the same study. They are also twice as likely to be interested in investing in art and collectables than older investors. Perhaps the biggest change will be the evolving mix of paid, earned, owned and shared channels marketers must use to “break through the clutter” to effectively engage, educate and activate relationships with these younger buyers. “From a go-to-market perspective, you have to experiment with new and non-traditional channels to meet the customer where they are,” according to Emily Childers in our webinar conversation . Emily heads Growth Marketing at Credit Karma – a personal finance company that engages 140 million Americans – half of whom are Millennials - in their marketplace to help them manage and optimize their finances. “To do that you will have to go to new places and constantly experiment. We are constantly changing the mix of owned, earned, paid, and shared channels to achieve a 360-degree view of the customer and looking for new channels and technologies that can give us first mover advantage,” adds Childers. Younger buyers have to be engaged differently because they are ‘digital natives’ born into an era of technological innovation. They grew up with smartphones, gaming, and social media as the norm - while Gen Z and Boomer customers had to react and adapt to digital channels. This means marketers must engage brands through a wider combination of channels – ranging from search, television, events, and email to OTT platforms, influencers, livestreaming, social commerce, and games. In particular, social media has become an increasingly important channel to reach younger customers. Over three quarters of Gen Z and Millennials feel comfortable purchasing on social media, according to research by the WHY Group . Younger Gen Z consumers are especially active on social media channels. For example, 80% of them spend time on the YouTube platform, 75% on Instagram, and 69% on TikTok. Half of them spend at least four hours a day on these platforms, according to a survey of 1,002 consumers ages 13 to 26, by Morning Consult Research Intelligence. The amount of time and attention they spend on these platforms is forcing marketers to raise the bar on the quality of their content, rethink their allocation of paid media relative to earned and shared media, and rework their attribution models. In particular, these new channels are changing the way marketers plan, create, deploy and leverage content, creative and messaging. “Today marketers need to be transitioning to content, messaging, and channels that appeal more to a younger audience. And that will look different in terms of being in shorter form, ‘social ready’, video, and in tune with their individualized interests,” adds David Master who along with Jennifer Ball, the CMO of Franklin Templeton and other leaders in the field, will be speaking about how content has become king in terms of driving sales and client retention in the asset management business. Overcoming bad content – in the form of misinformation is a big opportunity, according to Emily Childers. “Learning from the internet is the disease that this new generation faces. You need to combat it transparent systems, communications, credit scoring and education,” says Childers in our webinar conversation . “We see education is a big opportunity,” adds Kaitlyn Crowder . “In our business, if you are not educating customers you are not reaching them. Particularly with brokers – who are important influencers and channel partners in our business. We’ve had to find a way to educate within the limits of attention span by getting to the point quickly and making videos 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes to address the behavior and expectations of younger audience.” Confounding matters further, younger buyers want honesty, consistency, personalization and privacy all at the same time. For example, both Millennials and Gen Z want honest and transparent communication (97% and 96% respectively) and greater consistency in all their interactions with a company (95% and 93%), according to research by Salesforce . They also demand both personalization and privacy. On one hand over 91% of both Millennials and Gen Z want to be viewed as individuals, not numbers. On the other hand, over 92% want assurances that their customer information is used responsibly, and most would like their financial institution to provide advanced identity and credit protection according to the same study – and nearly half expressed interest in data protection for digital assets, according to a survey of 1,039 consumers by the Financial Brand. This is forcing marketers to change their governance, communication and data strategies. From a relationship standpoint, Financial Services marketers will be challenged to build trust with younger buyers according to the panelists. A Financial Brand study examining Millennial and Gen Z banking buying behaviors revealed that trust and security are top priorities when choosing a financial services provider. With all these constraints, changes and balances to navigate, you’d think markers would become conservative. In fact, the best marketers in the industry are embracing this challenge as an opportunity. “All of these changes, new channels, behaviors and trends make this a great time for marketing to create more value,” says Kaitlyn Crowder , Vice President, Marketing Director, North Avenue Capital in our webinar conversation . “You have to be courageous – and experiment like your life depended on it - because sticking with the status quo in terms of content, media and engagement channels will mean failure,” says Abel Flint of J.P. Morgan Payments . “You cannot let tradition or legacy get in the way of experimenting with new media content, and ways to go to market. As a long-established bank operating in rapidly changing payments landscape – we’ve had to build trust with a new generation of buyers. One avenue is finding ways to tap into the content and channels of publishers, while being authentic, to co-create content with them directly,” adds Flint who will be speaking about ways to make your brand stand out in a saturated and overwhelming multi-channel media environment. I’ll continue this conversation on November 7 th and 8th along with a roster of 45 leading marketing executives from banking, wealth and asset management, insurance and fintech industries speaking about the changing nature of marketing in financial services at the 11 th annual Digital Marketing in Financial Services Summit in NYC.

Could The Market Be Wrong About Ocean Fresh Berhad (KLSE:OFB) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 1:58 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 It is hard to get excited after looking at Ocean Fresh Berhad's (KLSE:OFB) recent performance, when its stock has declined 57% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Ocean Fresh Berhad's ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Ocean Fresh Berhad How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ocean Fresh Berhad is: 12% = RM5.5m ÷ RM47m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each MYR1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made MYR0.12 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. A Side By Side comparison of Ocean Fresh Berhad's Earnings Growth And 12% ROE To begin with, Ocean Fresh Berhad seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 10.0% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Ocean Fresh Berhad's significant 22% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. As a next step, we compared Ocean Fresh Berhad's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 22% in the same period. Story continues past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Ocean Fresh Berhad is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Is Ocean Fresh Berhad Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? While the company did pay out a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a regular dividend. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above. Conclusion In total, we are pretty happy with Ocean Fresh Berhad's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Let's not forget, business risk is also one of the factors that affects the price of the stock. So this is also an important area that investors need to pay attention to before making a decision on any business.

If you are in between tenants and want to boost the appeal of your rental to fetch higher monthly rent and attract better tenants, remodeling is one of the smartest financial moves you can make to improve your return on investment and rental property value. Smart home renovations that add new high-quality and functional features to your rental are more likely to increase the property’s rental value, helping to recoup the costs faster. The following renovation projects can not only boost your property’s value but will also create a home that entices renters. Chic entryways First impressions go a long way. You’ll want to hook prospective renters as they enter your property by presenting them with an inviting and unforgettable entryway. Get rid of your old door, and replace it with a bold, robust door that screams modern sophistication and perfectly complements your exterior. Mix sturdy materials, like steel or aluminum, with a raw, edgy design to give your front door a chic, industrial look. Industrial-style front doors are versatile and fit seamlessly into various architectural styles, from contemporary to rustic. These doors are tough and can withstand almost anything, making them perfect for both urban jungles and rural retreats. With the right secure locks, you’ll have peace of mind knowing your home’s entryway is as safe as it is stylish. Practical upgrades You can never go wrong with practical upgrades in traditional spaces, such as kitchens and bathrooms that are both visually appealing and also add functionality. The kitchen is the heart of a home, which is why it is also one of the main focal points that can make it or break it when selling to potential renters. You can start small by adding new cabinet doors or hardware and replacing water or light fixtures and appliances. But if you’re financially comfortable, invest in bigger projects like replacing countertops, sinks and flooring. Bathroom remodeling has many benefits, from creating a safer and more energy-efficient space to exuding healthfulness and tranquility through amenities for beauty and relaxation. Start with minor changes, like replacing a shower head with a rain shower and creating more ambient lighting. Adding safety features, like grab bars, shower seats, and anti-slip flooring, is also smart and can lessen your liability from accidents. If your budget permits, make bigger renovations by swapping out the flooring, tiles and cabinetry. Adding an antique tub or upgrading your existing tub to one that has spa features will contribute to a more luxurious atmosphere. Backyard experiences According to homeguide , a well-maintained yard can increase a property’s perceived value by 5 percent to 15 percent, giving a rental home higher long-term returns. Upgrading your yard doesn’t need to break the bank. Cut down on the hassle and costs of maintaining landscaping by installing an automatic watering system and planting hardy native trees, shrubs and flowers that can handle the climate with minimal care. Adding a garden shed also provides storage functionality, making your tenants’ lives easier and giving them a good reason to keep the garden looking tip-top. If you want to go bigger, consider adding an above-ground hot tub to promote luxury, relaxation and improved health. Building a deck provides the biggest facelift to a yard, and it also increases the value of your property with an estimated 44 percent return on investment . Decks maximize the space of a property and provide unique sources of outdoor entertainment and personal enjoyment, especially if they include comfortable outdoor furniture and a barbeque station. Luxurious touches It may be hard to justify investing in luxury items for a property you aren’t even living in. But for some landlords, a rental property also doubles as a family vacation home or represents a place they’d like to eventually sell at a profit, gift to a child or use as a retirement home. In those cases, it may be worthwhile to add some luxurious touches that will increase its rental value while also enhancing its long-term resale or personal value. Renovations that add luxury to a property vary in size and scope. Fireplaces transform plain living areas into warm and homely retreats, providing a highly sought-after amenity . Adding a sauna to your property can be a game-changer, not just for a tenant’s enjoyment and well-being but also for your bottom line when it comes time to cash in on your investment. Renters and potential buyers are increasingly interested in homes with wellness amenities, and regular use of saunas have been known to improve cardiovascular and respiratory health, reduce inflammation, and help with conditions like arthritis and chronic pain. Eco-friendly modernization Energy-efficient homes are attractive to tenants because less energy use translates to lower utility bills. You can start small by sealing any cracks around doors and windows, upgrading electrical sockets and light switches, installing smart thermostats, and replacing inefficient appliances with eco-friendly options. By installing water-efficient fixtures, such as low-flow faucets and showerheads and dual-flush toilets, you can seriously cut down water consumption without decreasing the quality of life for tenants, translating into substantial savings on water bills. Going green is the trend, and a bigger investment in solar panels can pay off in several ways. Solar panels and inverters offer a renewable energy source that results in energy independence, which many renters and homebuyers find appealing. Solar panels can lower electricity bills significantly, sometimes all the way to zero. In some cases, you may even get a refund from your electric provider. Depending on the state where your rental property is, you could also qualify for financial incentives from the government in the form of tax credits and rebates that offset the cost of installing solar panels and inverters. Security enhancements Security is not just a feature but a fundamental need for tenants, contributing significantly to their peace of mind and willingness to rent long-term. Installing certain gadgets around the exterior and in communal areas helps tenants feel safer and more confident about their personal safety and the security of their belongings. They also serve to protect your property from damage that can be inflicted by criminal activity. Security cameras that operate around the clock provide vigilance, recording all activity and serving as a deterrent to potential intruders. Likewise, motion sensor lights automatically illuminate when they detect movement, welcoming residents as they return home and deterring potential intruders by casting a spotlight on unexpected activity. Smart locks allow tenants to unlock their doors via smartphone apps or codes, bringing an unprecedented level of convenience and control and preventing lockouts that result in emergency calls to landlords. If you want to get really fancy, biometric security systems use unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to control access. Finally, installing emergency response systems provides tenants with a direct line to help and a swift response by emergency services by simply pressing a button. Such systems not only enhance tenant safety but also demonstrate a landlord’s commitment to the well-being of their residents, making properties more attractive to prospective renters.

Advertisement In years to come, Silicon Valley may view the events of the past few weeks as the moment the generative AI boom got too frothy. Investors spent the summer wondering if top AI stocks could continue to justify soaring valuations in the face of absent returns from their massive AI spending. Now, signs have emerged that they're not yet done with generative AI mania. As September rolled into October, some of the most significant investment areas in AI received fresh votes of confidence — be it in the chip space, the large language model arena, and devices. But there could be reason to feel cautious about the latest developments. Advertisement The Nvidia rival with just one main customer Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman is ready to take his company public. Ramsey Cardy Cerebras, a chip startup, included an eyebrow-raising detail in its IPO prospectus . But first, here's a quick primer on the Sunnyvale-based company. Founded in 2015, Cerebras aims to accelerate AI development by designing processors to train and deploy smarter LLMs. It believes these processors, among other offerings, can compete with the powerful chips sold by Nvidia. That's no walk in the park. Nvidia has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, having grown from a market capitalization of $364 billion at the start of 2023 to over $3 trillion. As things stand, however, Cerebras' plan to take it on involves generating the vast majority of its revenue from just one customer: Abu Dhabi-based AI firm G42. Advertisement According to its IPO prospectus, Cerebras — backed by investment firms such as Altimeter, Benchmark, and Coatue — generated 83% of its $78.6 million revenue in 2023 and 87% of the $136.4 million revenue generated in the first half of 2024 from G42. Founded in 2018, G42 has emerged as one of the Middle East's biggest AI opportunities. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, owns a stake, as do Microsoft and the private equity firm Silver Lake . There appears to be reason to work with G42, then, but by Cerebras' admission, an "adverse" change in the relationship could harm the chip firm. Related stories While Cerebras has sought to strengthen its customer base — it reached an agreement with oil giant Saudi Aramco in September — its revenue concentration will weigh on investors as it aims to raise $1 billion in its public listing at a $7 billion to $8 billion valuation, per Bloomberg. OpenAI reaches dizzying new heights Sam Altman's OpenAI secured a $157 billion valuation after raising $6.6 billion in its latest funding round. NurPhoto/Getty Warning signals emerged elsewhere as OpenAI shook up the market for LLMs on Wednesday by closing the most valuable funding round in Silicon Valley history. Advertisement While the ChatGPT maker announced that it had raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion valuation from a series of new and existing investors, it did so with a few notable asterisks. For one, per the Financial Times , OpenAI has asked its investors not to back its rivals, which include Anthropic, Elon Musk's xAI, and Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the startup founded in June by OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. While it has the right to do this, the ask is unusual in the world of startup investing, where venture capitalists often spread their bets. Gary Marcus, a professor who testified next to OpenAI's Sam Altman at a Congress hearing in 2023, described the move as OpenAI "running scared." David Sacks, general partner at Craft Ventures, called the ask a "shady" one. "The mask is really coming off," he wrote on X. It is also worth taking a closer look at some of the investors in its latest round. As my colleague Darius Rafieyan noted earlier this week , some of the most "prolific bubble chasers" — investors with a track record of betting on companies close to their peak — now count themselves as OpenAI backers. Think SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that burned billions of dollars on WeWork, and Tiger Global, an investment fund that suffered brutal losses in recent years after going on huge startup betting sprees. Advertisement This has taken place against a backdrop of wider challenges. OpenAI no longer has a chief technology officer after Mira Murati quit the firm late last month, becoming the latest top-tier executive to depart. The company has also been battling to reverse its lossmaking operations. According to a September report from The New York Times , OpenAI's monthly revenue grew to $300 million in August —but it has projected $5 billion in losses this year. AI's new form factors get a Meta push Mark Zuckerberg is embedding AI into Meta's new AR glasses, Orion. Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images The other notable sign of market frothiness came as Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a bold new wearable device for the AI era: Meta's Orion. The augmented reality glasses, introduced at the company's Connect conference in late September, put AI front and center by embedding the technology in a way that "can sense and understand the world around you," according to Meta. Advertisement While they have impressed — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave a glowing endorsement of the wearables in a promotional video, and Meta's stock responded positively after the event — there are a few matters to consider beyond the hype for it. The first is cost. According to The Verge's Alex Heath , who spoke to Meta executives, the cost of building a single Orion unit at present is a steep $10,000. Even if that cost can be brought down — something Orion lead Rahul Prasad told The Verge would be a focus of the device's next development phase — Meta will need to contend with the fact that appetite for these wearables hasn't exactly impressed in the past. Meta rival Snapchat took a go at introducing glasses to the market in the mid-2010s but failed to make a splash after incurring a $40 million loss on them . It is taking another crack with AI-embedded eyewear, announcing a partnership last month with OpenAI to embed its tech. Advertisement Other form factors for AI that have emerged recently, such as the Humane AI pin that launched in April and the pocketable rabbit R1 introduced in January, have largely flopped, too. Where does this leave us? In short, a lossmaking startup must justify its $157 billion valuation. A chip firm worth up to $8 billion must persuade investors not to worry about its undiversified revenue streams. Meta will need to convince consumers to switch to another way of interacting with AI entirely. All of these things may come to pass. If so, this will be seen as a juncture where AI goes on to truly revolutionize the industries it touches — and repay the faith of investors. But if history is anything to go by, the high-stakes tech world is rarely plain sailing. Read next Watch: How Twitter panic took down Silicon Valley Bank Tech AI OpenAI More...

Advertisement Days after Hurricane Helene devastated Florida and four other states, Compass real-estate agent Alexis Smith-Frady is picking up the pieces in her own home. More than three feet of water flooded her 1,400-square-foot bungalow in Bradenton, she said, adding that a FEMA inspector who visited deemed it uninhabitable. Now, she's bouncing between hotels until she figures out a more permanent solution. "We have kind of a two-level house — it's not a two-story, but there are two levels," Smith-Frady told Business Insider. "The top level was spared last year with Idalia , and then this year it got our entire house." Advertisement She said she did not have flood insurance for the first 11 years she lived there but now has flood and hazard insurance that costs her about $7,000 a year. By contrast, Smith-Frady added, she owns a cabin in North Carolina where the insurance bill is about $700 a year. She's not sure whether to repair the existing home or start from scratch. "If we fix our home, it's going to be a three- to six-month process," Smith-Frady said. "But if we build, it will probably be closer to 18 months because there's going to be quite a few people trying to do the same thing," she added. Advertisement Hurricane Helene caused $30.5 billion to $47.5 billion in wind and flood damage across 16 states, CoreLogic estimated. The real-estate data firm expects the National Flood Insurance Program to provide about $4.5 to $6.5 billion of insurance to homeowners across Florida and the southeastern US — including in parts of Florida that haven't experienced a hurricane like this in a while. Smith-Frady lives inland, and while her home is on a river and susceptible to flooding, the southwest part of Florida is usually spared significant destruction from hurricanes. The last major hurricane to hit the Tampa Bay area , where Sarasota is, was in 1921. It's a harsh reality that many Florida homeowners may face the effects of hurricanes or flooding at some point — and they're reminded of it often when their flood or home insurance bill is due . Florida is the most at-risk state for hurricanes, with nearly one out of every three homes — a total of 3 million — susceptible to storm-surge flooding, according to a hurricane risk model by insurance software company Guidewire. Hurricanes haven't significantly affected Florida home prices, real-estate data experts told Business Insider this week, and the Sunshine State is still one of the most popular states to move to . Advertisement However, real-estate agents on the ground are still unsure what will happen next. Increasing chances of natural disasters and flooding coupled with high insurance bills and homes that remain relatively expensive can make homeownership in Florida a pricey — and risky — proposition. A few residents want out, local brokers said, while others are aware of the costs and plan to stay put. The cost of insurance is making some home sellers lower their asking prices On September 27, the morning after Helene tore through the city of St. Petersburg, real-estate agent Katie Mallah received a call from a client with a recently-listed three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in the Shore Acres neighborhood, a collection of man-made islands. Related stories They asked Mallah to slash the asking price of their house, which had sustained nearly three feet of water damage. "They wanted to get out," Mallah told Business Insider. "They said, 'We'll demo everything, but we want to price it to just get out. So come up with that number.'" Advertisement A property in Shore Acres, Florida, impacted by Hurricane Helene. Courtesy of Katie Mallah Mallah chopped the listing price by 40%, lowering it from $375,000 to $225,000. Within hours, she said, she was inundated with about 25 calls and 50 text messages from investors interested in tearing down the home and building a new one. Mallah set a Tuesday deadline for all offers, just five days after the storm. Part of the seller's rush, Mallah said, was the chilling effect rising insurance premiums are having on this segment of the market. Luxury buyers might be able to brush off the increased cost, she added, but for buyers of homes under $500,000, it's becoming a "deal killer." Mallah's client didn't want to sit around and wait. Compass agent Heather Cameron is representing a home for sale near a canal in Tampa that was also affected by the hurricane. Advertisement "The property is in the mid-$400,000s," Cameron told BI. "That home got flooded during the storm. So we'll see what insurance actually does cover." She said that homeowners dealing with damage from Helene are still waiting to see how much their insurance might pay out. Some don't carry insurance at all, she added, either because costs are so high or because insurance doesn't cover as much as they thought it would. "I have clients spending tens of thousands of dollars a year on homeowners and flood insurance," Cameron said. Some area home sellers are even considering wooing potential buyers by offering a credit that would cover flood insurance for a year, she said. Advertisement A street in Shore Acres, Florida, where residents are attempting to rebuild after Hurricane Helene. Courtesy of Katie Mallah Floridians face some challenges securing insurance. Major providers like Farmers Insurance and Bankers Insurance have pulled out of the state in recent years , and under new FEMA guidelines premiums in some parts of the state are expected to rise by over 300% in coming years, according to the Miami Herald. Related stories In May 2024, the average cost of flood insurance in Florida was $781 a year, according to personal-finance company NerdWallet. Many homewoners also buy home insurance: The typical Florida household paid over $10,000 for home insurance in 2023, according to data from Insurify, and Capital Economics found those premiums are rising at the fastest rate in 20 years. Palm Beach agent Holly Meyer Lucas said many homeowners who aren't required to purchase flood insurance choose to go without it. "So many homeowners have dropped flood insurance or whittled their own insurance down to the absolute minimum," Meyer Lucas told Business Insider. Advertisement This creates a particularly thorny situation as flood and wind insurance are often separate policies, Meyer Lucas pointed out. So, if a homeowner lives outside traditional flood zones, they may forgo specific flood protection, but still pay for wind and homeowners insurance. But when they are hit with a historic storm surge like Helene, it becomes difficult to separate what was solely water damage. "It basically makes the home a total loss if they don't have flood insurance," Meyer Lucas said. Meyer Lucas anticipates more situations where fed-up Florida homeowners, who may have more equity in their homes than cash to repair, choose to cut their losses and sell as quickly as possible. "We're going to see a lot of people needing to sell their homes because they can't afford the remediation," she said. Advertisement It's hard to predict if Helene will sink home prices — homebuyers still love Florida Even with the risks, multiple experts told Business Insider it's hard to say whether real-estate prices will immediately falter in the Sunshine State. "We have not seen an event, even one like Hurricane Ian, that has had an industry-shifting effect on the real-estate market," Jon Schneyer, the catastrophe response director at data firm CoreLogic, told Business Insider. It's true that some people may leave. The Wall Street Journal reported that many homeowners in Shore Acres, Florida, a coastal town six miles outside St. Petersburg, want to sell to escape the flooding. And some of the most dire forecasters predict that sell-offs like this could bring down property prices. Cameron told BI that Shore Acres was known for flooding before Helene, and while she can see more inland properties, which are not in flood zones, increase in price, many people prefer to rebuild or move locally rather than leave the state entirely. Advertisement "I think the people really want to live here," she said. "And I think the demand is still going to be very high to live here in Tampa, St. Pete, and Sarasota." Still, some experts believe risks haven't been properly baked into home prices, resulting in a $50.2 billion overvaluation in Florida's housing market, according to a recent study published in Nature. "In many parts of the US — and particularly coastal counties, but also in parts of Appalachia as well — housing markets are not efficiently pricing flood risk into home values and that's causing this housing bubble to occur," Jesse Gourevitch, one of the study's authors and an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, told Business Insider. "In Florida, there's really high flood risk, which I think is broadly understood, but that the cost associated with that flood risk is not being captured in home values." Instead, there may be "localized downsizings" as certain areas develop a stigma after particularly bad storms, explains Ryan D'Amario, a vice president of personal lines property underwriting at insurance analytics firm Verisk. But predicting exactly when and where an extreme weather event is likely to happen is so "broad and wide" that many homeowners are likely to continue with business as usual. Advertisement "The storms are happening so diversely in so many different areas of the state," D'Amario told Business Insider. "The demand will always be present." Smith-Frady, the real-estate agent whose Bradenton home flooded, said part of living in Florida is understanding the tradeoff between risk and reward. "We live in a great place — it's wonderful," Smith-Frady said. "We haven't had a storm surge on this part of the Gulf Coast in over 100 years. It's easy for generations to forget that you're susceptible to that. But the reality is that that is the risk that we take by living on the coast."

Is There An Opportunity With CBIZ, Inc.'s (NYSE:CBZ) 46% Undervaluation? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 1:36 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights CBIZ's estimated fair value is US$120 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$65.37 suggests CBIZ is potentially 46% undervalued When compared to the industry average discount to fair value of 17%, CBIZ's competitors seem to be trading at a lesser discount Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of CBIZ, Inc. ( NYSE:CBZ ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for CBIZ The Method We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$177.0m US$201.0m US$221.5m US$239.0m US$254.1m US$267.2m US$278.8m US$289.4m US$299.3m US$308.6m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Est @ 13.54% Est @ 10.23% Est @ 7.91% Est @ 6.29% Est @ 5.15% Est @ 4.36% Est @ 3.80% Est @ 3.41% Est @ 3.14% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$166 US$177 US$183 US$186 US$186 US$183 US$180 US$175 US$170 US$165 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.8b After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%. Story continues Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$309m× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.5%) = US$7.9b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%) 10 = US$4.2b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.0b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$65.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf Important Assumptions Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CBIZ as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.966. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for CBIZ Strength Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Weakness Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Professional Services industry. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat No apparent threats visible for CBZ. Next Steps: Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

A Look At The Fair Value Of Hock Lian Seng Holdings Limited (SGX:J2T) Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Oct 6, 2024, 3:10 AM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights The projected fair value for Hock Lian Seng Holdings is S$0.42 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With S$0.35 share price, Hock Lian Seng Holdings appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Hock Lian Seng Holdings Limited ( SGX:J2T ) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Hock Lian Seng Holdings Step By Step Through The Calculation We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (SGD, Millions) S$16.1m S$13.2m S$11.7m S$10.8m S$10.3m S$10.0m S$9.89m S$9.88m S$9.93m S$10.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -26.33% Est @ -17.78% Est @ -11.80% Est @ -7.61% Est @ -4.68% Est @ -2.63% Est @ -1.19% Est @ -0.19% Est @ 0.52% Est @ 1.01% Present Value (SGD, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% S$15.1 S$11.7 S$9.7 S$8.4 S$7.6 S$6.9 S$6.4 S$6.1 S$5.7 S$5.4 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = S$83m The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = S$10m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = S$247m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = S$247m÷ ( 1 + 6.3%) 10 = S$134m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is S$217m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of S$0.3, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hock Lian Seng Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Hock Lian Seng Holdings Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Currently debt free. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Construction market. Opportunity Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine J2T's earnings prospects. Threat No apparent threats visible for J2T. Next Steps: Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Could The Market Be Wrong About Ocean Fresh Berhad (KLSE:OFB) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 1:58 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 It is hard to get excited after looking at Ocean Fresh Berhad's (KLSE:OFB) recent performance, when its stock has declined 57% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Ocean Fresh Berhad's ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Ocean Fresh Berhad How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ocean Fresh Berhad is: 12% = RM5.5m ÷ RM47m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each MYR1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made MYR0.12 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. A Side By Side comparison of Ocean Fresh Berhad's Earnings Growth And 12% ROE To begin with, Ocean Fresh Berhad seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 10.0% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Ocean Fresh Berhad's significant 22% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. As a next step, we compared Ocean Fresh Berhad's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 22% in the same period. Story continues past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Ocean Fresh Berhad is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Is Ocean Fresh Berhad Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? While the company did pay out a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a regular dividend. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above. Conclusion In total, we are pretty happy with Ocean Fresh Berhad's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Let's not forget, business risk is also one of the factors that affects the price of the stock. So this is also an important area that investors need to pay attention to before making a decision on any business. Our risks dashboard would have the 2 risks we have identified for Ocean Fresh Berhad. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Share on Facebook Post Share to Flipboard Email Show more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Pin it Submit to Reddit Post to Tumblr Share on WhatsApp Print This Page Hollywood may be grappling with painful change but for Roeg Sutherland , co-Head of CAA’s Media Finance department and its International Film Group, the disruption represents an opportunity for the independent film sector that he has supported for the past two decades. “If there’s true disruption in the marketplace, it means that not enough movies are being made by the studios. There are still slots to fill and there’s always someone who wants to watch a movie,” Sutherland told the Zurich Summit on Saturday. “If the studios are making less movies, that means we get to make more movies, and then we get to sell them. There’s a real opportunity for us to have a real impact on the market.” Related Stories Festivals Fabrice Du Welz Discusses True Crime Marc Dutroux Affair Thriller 'Maldoror' & Influence Of Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood' News Zurich Film Festival 2024 Winners -- Full List Sutherland was speaking in an onstage conversation at the Zurich Film Festival ’s annual industry conflab ahead of receiving its Game Changer Award, celebrating his work getting hundreds of movies over the line . Speaking to FilmNation Entertainment Founder and CEO Glen Basner and Deadline’s Co-Editor-in-Chief Film Mike Fleming Jr, Sutherland gave a candid and lively insight into his journey to becoming one of the key movers and shakers in the independent film financing world. He revealed he had never been tempted to follow his parents, Donald Sutherland and Francine Racette (who was in the audience), or half-brother Kiefer Sutherland into acting. Brothers Rossif and Angus are also actors. Aside from a self-described lack of talent for acting, he said his late father’s attitude to the process of moviemaking had also played its part. “My father would always say, ‘As an actor, you give 100% of yourself’… he refused to watch his movies, because he felt like only 50% of what he would give was actually on the screen,” said Sutherland. “That was interesting to me, I realized that I was much more interested in controlling the whole, rather than controlling the part. So that was my way of justifying not acting, even though I would have never gotten a job as an actor.” His roster of jobs before finding his calling at CAA, ranged from movie PA to film editor and an extremely brief stint as stand-in for Marlon Brando. “That lasted all of 35 seconds,” he recalled of the latter gig, revealing Brando had kicked him off the set for talking while the actor was trying to learn his lines between takes. It was bruising experience, given Brando had been one of his life long idols, in an admiration instilled in him by his mother. Sutherland credited his father’s agent Ron Meyer with giving him his first break in CAA’s legendary mailroom. “It felt a little strange. My parents didn’t particularly love agents. Growing up, the community of actors and artists around them weren’t at dinner, shall we say, celebrating agents,” he recalled. “I thought they were sending me to prison, but it turned out to be the best experience I ever had in my life.” Even then, Sutherland said, it took him time to find his “spot” at the agency. “I was supposed to be in the talent department, but I was not a natural fit. And truly what we do, the independent, international stuff, didn’t really start until around 2005, or at least, didn’t start to flourish, because everything was being made by studios,” he explained. “I was thrown into a department that was mostly a servicing department for clients who had a project that they wanted to do when they weren’t working on a big studio movie. But then the business evolved after the economic crisis in 2006 and a lot more of these movies were left to people like us to go figure out financing on.” Some two decades later, CAA Media Finance is the go-to for many producers trying to put together an elevated independent project. Glen Basner, Roeg Sutherland and Mike Fleming Jr at the Zurich Summit Long-time collaborator Basner suggested 60 to 70% of the independent films successfully released over the past 20 years, had been supported in some shape or form by Sutherland and the Media Finance team. Sutherland runs the division with fellow Co-Head Ben Kramer, also a perennial figure at major festivals and markets and who steers the dealmaking and operations with Sutherland. “That’s maybe true,” Sutherland said of Basner’s estimate, “but it doesn’t come from our group, it comes from our clients and we’re lucky to represent some of the best people in the world that give us the ability to deliver the packages that you finance. We’re great middlemen.” None of it would be possible without long-time trusted financing partners such as Basner, AGC Studios CEO Stuart Ford or international sales maverick Vincent Maraval, he added. “Our purpose is to make sure there’s a healthy ecosystem in the marketplace, to make sure that we take care of our clients and that we set up movies in an appropriate way, that not only respects their needs and their desires, but also the needs and desires of the film financing community with international distributors and whoever may be financing,” said Sutherland. “Sometimes it’s worldwide deals. For the most part, it’s piecemeal, with a foreign sales agent being part of it, and selling off international territories, bringing in an equity investor, making sure that the equity investor is in a safe position if they go into making a movie without having distribution in place.” Sutherland said pulling together the finance for early films in his career such as Darren Aronofsky’s The Wrestler , starring Mickey Rourke, and Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker , had been part of his learning process. “When you’re that young and don’t know how anything works, and kind of learning on the fly, you just kind of trust the process. You don’t over complicate and overthink things,” he said. The Wrestler, ©Copyright Twentieth Century Fox. Courtesy Everett Collection “Vincent Maraval told me, ‘We’re going do The Wrestler .’ I’m like, ‘Okay, we’re going to do The Wrestler .’ Now, I would ask him about 400 questions about how much he can pre-sell, how much we’re going to be able to borrow against the territories that he doesn’t presell, and where am I going to be able to find them at four o’clock in the morning when we need to sign a deal?” A big part of the learning curve, said Sutherland, was learning to roll with the punches that arise in the process of pulling a project together. “It’s like the movie Force Majeure . The avalanche is going to show up at some point in time, and then it’s a question of whether you run off the balcony or, you stay there and protect your family,” he said. Looking back at the raft of films CAA Media Finance has helped to bring to fruition over the past two decades, Sutherland said he and his team would never seek to take credit for a film’s existence. “We help the community get the tools to understand how to sell it, but it doesn’t happen because of us. Take Black Swan , very difficult movie to set up, but its genius is Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of help to get people to understand what the director’s vision is and for them to connect with it. But ultimately, we’re just facilitators.” He suggested that Black Swan had gotten lost in translation in the conversations between the director and the financiers. The issue had been that the screenplay read like a drama, while Aronofsky’s vision was for it to be a psychological thriller. “It wasn’t on the page, so people didn’t see it automatically. They’re like, ‘Is he going to tell us it’s a thriller and then deliver a drama?” recalled Sutherland. He filled the gap in the budget through producer Brian Oliver, who had raised $8 million from Louisiana-based investors at the time. “He’s like, ‘Roeg, I’m going to make four horror movies.’ And I’m like, ‘No, you’re not, you’re going to do Black Swan ,” recalled Sutherland. “That worked well for him,” he added, saying Oliver had made $70 million on the back of his investment, after the film grossed $329 million worldwide. Looking at more recent history, Basner recalled how Sutherland had spearheaded the virtual Cannes market, with Maraval, when the physical festival had been shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. “What were we supposed to do? Lick our wounds and say, ‘Oh God, the business is dead. We can’t create content’,” he said. “People were stuck at home. We had to figure out a way to get movies made. There’d never been a better time for us to sell movies. The only way we could do that was to create these virtual markets.” “We would have weekly phone calls with 500 people on it. We were like, ‘How are we going to reorganize ourselves, and how are we going to make it exciting?,” he said. Sutherland added that the success of the initiative had been down to the fact that the entire independent community had come together. “The only way that we succeed is when we work together. When we work against each other, nothing good happens. When my entire team comes together and works with the entire independent community and we all come together, that’s when we’re successful.” Roeg Sutherland at the Zurich Summit James Gorman Named Chairman; Iger’s Successor To Be Announced In Early 2026 Mike Flanagan Reteaming With Stephen King For ‘Carrie’ Series At Amazon Grandview Acquired By TPG’s Initial Group, Merges With Untitled Ent.

Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) Faces Workforce Reductions Amid Shifting AI Market Dynamics; Bernstein Highlights Profit Challenges in Training vs. Inferencing Read full article Usman Kabir Sun, Oct 6, 2024, 4:21 PM 5 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk. While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities . This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services. Story continues Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants. Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). A team of IT experts discussing the latest network security trends over a laptop screen. Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells, and supports various comprehensive and integrated solutions, products, and services. Investment advisory Bernstein recently penned an investor note on the AI market, highlighting that while investors generally believed more spending was going to inferencing, ever-increasing efficiencies in that area had prompted Bernstein to contend that training cost significantly more. Referencing Dell, the advisory said the fortunes of the firm remained tethered to training and Tier 2 hyperscalers for the foreseeable future, where profits were very low, as opposed to on-premise inferencing, where margins were likely to be much higher. Latest reports, published by news platform Bloomberg, claims that Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) will continue to reduce its workforce this year. The move is part of a larger plan by the hardware company to control costs amid concerns that demand for PCs hasn’t rebounded and sales of servers optimized for artificial intelligence aren’t as profitable as other products. Dell has said that a limitation on outside hiring, job reorganizations and other actions will produce continued reduction in our overall headcount in the fiscal year ending in February 2025. Overall DELL ranks 15th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.

Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Faces Lower Earnings Projections Amid Semiconductor Market Challenges; Analysts Highlight Potential for Recovery by 2026 Read full article Usman Kabir Sun, Oct 6, 2024, 4:00 PM 5 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk. While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities . This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services. Story continues Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants. Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor industry. Analysts led by CJ Muse at Cantor Fitzgerald recently penned an investor note on the semi market, detailing that recent issues from Intel and Samsung were likely to negatively impact the semiconductor equipment market, with wafer fab equipment spending coming in lower-than-expected. Referencing Applied Materials, the analysts detailed that the lower estimates would translate to earnings implications for the company, and forecast the chipmaker was likely to earn $10 and $12 per share in fiscal 2025 and 2026. The analysts also discussed the possibility of rerating the stock. Per the note, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock, on 1yr average multiple, seemed cheap, but on 3yr and 5yr averages, it had considerable downside. The note claimed that orders were bottoming and fundamentals would modestly recover in CY25 with even greater recovery into CY26, even as regulatory risk remained, but cyclically, the market was at the point where you were supposed to buy the stock. Overall AMAT ranks 18th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

'I am getting increasingly queasy': JPMorgan's strategy chief on why investors should dial back risk amid market distortions Read full article Kelly Cloonan Sun, Oct 6, 2024, 9:31 PM 3 min read Link Copied 41 David Kelly, chief global strategist, JPMorgan Asset Management JPMorgan Asset Management Indexes have soared on strong economic data and a big rate cut from the Fed. Yet, as markets eye a soft landing, potential shocks pose a higher risk to investors, David Kelly says. He says Americans should dial back risk and position funds away from growth stocks and toward value. Strong economic data and a big rate cut last month have fueled bullish sentiment, but investors should be wary of adding more risk, according to JPMorgan Asset Management's David Kelly. The firm's chief global strategist says the promise of a soft landing has encouraged Americans to pour into riskier assets at the exact time they shouldn't be. "I will say that although I think this is positive for the equity market, I am getting increasingly queasy about the fact that the equity market keeps on pricing in a soft landing," Kelly told Business Insider. He said that as the market prices in a soft landing , valuations rise, which means any shock to the market could send asset prices tumbling. "Markets have gone up a lot and become more distorted, and because they're more distorted and at higher valuations, they're more risky," he said. At the same time, the average American's wealth has soared . According to Fed data, the total aggregate wealth of American households grew by about $50 trillion in the last five years. That means many middle-income households that couldn't afford retirement just a few years ago now can, Kelly says. As a result, investors shouldn't take on more risk than they need to, he says. "They should dial back risk. There's no need to increase risk if you've got enough money to do the things that you want to do," Kelly said. Kelly was particularly cautious over keeping money tied up in high-flying growth stocks. "At the very time when I think logic would dictate that investors take a little bit of risk off the table, they are passively allowing risk to accumulate on the table," he said. Instead, he recommended investors rebalance their portfolios, funneling funds out of growth stocks and toward value shares, international equities, and alternatives. Kelly says the market has been trending toward a soft landing for quite some time, and Friday's blockbuster jobs report only strengthened the case. The report showed a dip in the unemployment rate from 4.2% to 4.1%, with 254,000 nonfarm payrolls added, blowing past estimates of around 150,000. The strong report all but dashed hopes for another big rate cut next month, with investors quickly lowering the odds of a 50 basis point move from 33% to less than 1%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . Story continues Kelly acknowledged, though, that the data leaves room for error, so it's possible that last month's employment appeared weaker than reality and this month seemed stronger than reality. Regardless, he says the report validates that the US has a healthy, strong labor market and that the economy is on a "very nice soft landing path." Kelly expects the Fed to cut an additional 50 basis points over the course of its next two meetings, and another 100 next year. Back in August, when a surprise increase in unemployment triggered a massive global sell-off , Kelly told Business Insider that the Fed needs to do more to broadcast its confidence in the economy. Now, he says the Fed should continue showing its confidence, and show that it can take its time cutting interest rates. "The more the Federal Reserve seems to be taking its time and not overly concerned, the more that's going to do to support confidence," he said.

Private Equity Ruins Tech Companies | Zachary Hamed The Wordpress and open source communities have lots of thoughts on Matt Mullenweg’s actions after his talk at WordCamp . Much of this commentary has overlooked what I think is a core concern at the heart of Matt’s argument: the growing role and influence of private equity in tech, particularly in open source. PE firms raise money from institutional investors and high net worth individuals to buy companies, restructure them, and sell them later for a profit. They’re all about maximizing returns ASAP, usually in a 3-7 year window. That’s a shorter timeframe than the typical founder or public company shareholder, and far shorter than Matt’s time horizon : I would like future generations to grow up with a web that is more open, more free, gives more liberty, and so open source is really my life’s work, even above WordPress and anything else. I hope to work on it the rest of my life. When a PE firm acquires a tech company, a few things happen. The new owners focus on aggressive cost-cutting and “streamlining” operations to boost short-term profitability. This is extremely destructive, leading to mass layoffs, reduced benefits, and wholesale outsourcing. At the same time, PE firms often load up acquired companies with debt, extracting cash while leaving the businesses more financially unstable. With a myopic focus on an exit, long-term investments in innovation, customer service, and employee development fall by the wayside. The result? Private equity backed companies are 10 times more likely to go bankrupt than public companies. The basic business model of private equity firms often leads to disasters like that at ManorCare for three fundamental reasons. First, private equity firms typically buy businesses only for the short term. Second, they often load up the companies they buy with debt and extract onerous fees. And third, they insulate themselves from the consequences, both legal and financial, of their actions. This leads to a practice of extraction, rather than investment, of destruction, rather than creation. While not every company owned by private equity firms goes bankrupt, the chance of disaster meaningfully increases under their ownership. — Plunder by Brendan Ballou Open source communities are particularly vulnerable to this model. They’re delicate ecosystems of volunteer contributors, transparent governance, and values-aligned sponsorships. Applying the PE playbook can easily destabilize that entire balance. Take, for example, Vista Equity Partners' $1 billion acquisition of Acquia in 2019. Acquia is the main commercial backer of Drupal, another popular open source CMS. In the years since the acquisition, the Drupal community has visibly struggled. Acquia appears to be contributing less code and providing less financial support to the ecosystem. Just a few days ago, Acquia quietly laid off almost a third of its staff . With fewer resources, core development and maintenance have slowed. This coincides with a sharp decline in Drupal’s market share compared to competitors like WordPress: The Drupal story demonstrates how applying PE tactics to open source projects can undermine their health and sustainability. By nature, these communities aren’t a fit for rapid extraction of outsized returns. Their vitality depends on reinvestment, transparency, and long-term stability — the opposite of the PE model. Toys “R” Us . Simon & Schuster . Even America’s ports . Not everyone can push back against private equity, but I believe we should support companies like Wordpress that have a long history of admirable values and prescient leadership. Wordpress powers more than 40% of the web — its community’s health is too important to ignore. Zachary Hamed @zmh

Some Florida homeowners are reevaluating their costs and comfort with risk post-Hurricane Helene. One seller near St. Petersburg slashed the asking price on their home, which was flooded, by 40%. Some weigh whether homeownership in Florida is worth it given the high cost of both insurance and homes.

Advertisement Days after Hurricane Helene devastated Florida and four other states, Compass real-estate agent Alexis Smith-Frady is picking up the pieces in her own home. More than three feet of water flooded her 1,400-square-foot bungalow in Bradenton, she said, adding that a FEMA inspector who visited deemed it uninhabitable. Now, she's bouncing between hotels until she figures out a more permanent solution. "We have kind of a two-level house — it's not a two-story, but there are two levels," Smith-Frady told Business Insider. "The top level was spared last year with Idalia , and then this year it got our entire house." Advertisement She said she did not have flood insurance for the first 11 years she lived there but now has flood and hazard insurance that costs her about $7,000 a year. By contrast, Smith-Frady added, she owns a cabin in North Carolina where the insurance bill is about $700 a year. She's not sure whether to repair the existing home or start from scratch. "If we fix our home, it's going to be a three- to six-month process," Smith-Frady said. "But if we build, it will probably be closer to 18 months because there's going to be quite a few people trying to do the same thing," she added. Advertisement Hurricane Helene caused $30.5 billion to $47.5 billion in wind and flood damage across 16 states, CoreLogic estimated. The real-estate data firm expects the National Flood Insurance Program to provide about $4.5 to $6.5 billion of insurance to homeowners across Florida and the southeastern US — including in parts of Florida that haven't experienced a hurricane like this in a while. Smith-Frady lives inland, and while her home is on a river and susceptible to flooding, the southwest part of Florida is usually spared significant destruction from hurricanes. The last major hurricane to hit the Tampa Bay area , where Sarasota is, was in 1921. It's a harsh reality that many Florida homeowners may face the effects of hurricanes or flooding at some point — and they're reminded of it often when their flood or home insurance bill is due . Florida is the most at-risk state for hurricanes, with nearly one out of every three homes — a total of 3 million — susceptible to storm-surge flooding, according to a hurricane risk model by insurance software company Guidewire. Hurricanes haven't significantly affected Florida home prices, real-estate data experts told Business Insider this week, and the Sunshine State is still one of the most popular states to move to . Advertisement However, real-estate agents on the ground are still unsure what will happen next. Increasing chances of natural disasters and flooding coupled with high insurance bills and homes that remain relatively expensive can make homeownership in Florida a pricey — and risky — proposition. A few residents want out, local brokers said, while others are aware of the costs and plan to stay put. The cost of insurance is making some home sellers lower their asking prices On September 27, the morning after Helene tore through the city of St. Petersburg, real-estate agent Katie Mallah received a call from a client with a recently-listed three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in the Shore Acres neighborhood, a collection of man-made islands. Related stories They asked Mallah to slash the asking price of their house, which had sustained nearly three feet of water damage. "They wanted to get out," Mallah told Business Insider. "They said, 'We'll demo everything, but we want to price it to just get out. So come up with that number.'" Advertisement A property in Shore Acres, Florida, impacted by Hurricane Helene. Courtesy of Katie Mallah Mallah chopped the listing price by 40%, lowering it from $375,000 to $225,000. Within hours, she said, she was inundated with about 25 calls and 50 text messages from investors interested in tearing down the home and building a new one. Mallah set a Tuesday deadline for all offers, just five days after the storm. Part of the seller's rush, Mallah said, was the chilling effect rising insurance premiums are having on this segment of the market. Luxury buyers might be able to brush off the increased cost, she added, but for buyers of homes under $500,000, it's becoming a "deal killer." Mallah's client didn't want to sit around and wait. Compass agent Heather Cameron is representing a home for sale near a canal in Tampa that was also affected by the hurricane. Advertisement "The property is in the mid-$400,000s," Cameron told BI. "That home got flooded during the storm. So we'll see what insurance actually does cover." She said that homeowners dealing with damage from Helene are still waiting to see how much their insurance might pay out. Some don't carry insurance at all, she added, either because costs are so high or because insurance doesn't cover as much as they thought it would. "I have clients spending tens of thousands of dollars a year on homeowners and flood insurance," Cameron said. Some area home sellers are even considering wooing potential buyers by offering a credit that would cover flood insurance for a year, she said. Advertisement A street in Shore Acres, Florida, where residents are attempting to rebuild after Hurricane Helene. Courtesy of Katie Mallah Floridians face some challenges securing insurance. Major providers like Farmers Insurance and Bankers Insurance have pulled out of the state in recent years , and under new FEMA guidelines premiums in some parts of the state are expected to rise by over 300% in coming years, according to the Miami Herald. Related stories In May 2024, the average cost of flood insurance in Florida was $781 a year, according to personal-finance company NerdWallet. Many homewoners also buy home insurance: The typical Florida household paid over $10,000 for home insurance in 2023, according to data from Insurify, and Capital Economics found those premiums are rising at the fastest rate in 20 years. Palm Beach agent Holly Meyer Lucas said many homeowners who aren't required to purchase flood insurance choose to go without it. "So many homeowners have dropped flood insurance or whittled their own insurance down to the absolute minimum," Meyer Lucas told Business Insider. Advertisement This creates a particularly thorny situation as flood and wind insurance are often separate policies, Meyer Lucas pointed out. So, if a homeowner lives outside traditional flood zones, they may forgo specific flood protection, but still pay for wind and homeowners insurance. But when they are hit with a historic storm surge like Helene, it becomes difficult to separate what was solely water damage. "It basically makes the home a total loss if they don't have flood insurance," Meyer Lucas said. Meyer Lucas anticipates more situations where fed-up Florida homeowners, who may have more equity in their homes than cash to repair, choose to cut their losses and sell as quickly as possible. "We're going to see a lot of people needing to sell their homes because they can't afford the remediation," she said. Advertisement It's hard to predict if Helene will sink home prices — homebuyers still love Florida Even with the risks, multiple experts told Business Insider it's hard to say whether real-estate prices will immediately falter in the Sunshine State. "We have not seen an event, even one like Hurricane Ian, that has had an industry-shifting effect on the real-estate market," Jon Schneyer, the catastrophe response director at data firm CoreLogic, told Business Insider. It's true that some people may leave. The Wall Street Journal reported that many homeowners in Shore Acres, Florida, a coastal town six miles outside St. Petersburg, want to sell to escape the flooding. And some of the most dire forecasters predict that sell-offs like this could bring down property prices. Cameron told BI that Shore Acres was known for flooding before Helene, and while she can see more inland properties, which are not in flood zones, increase in price, many people prefer to rebuild or move locally rather than leave the state entirely. Advertisement "I think the people really want to live here," she said. "And I think the demand is still going to be very high to live here in Tampa, St. Pete, and Sarasota." Still, some experts believe risks haven't been properly baked into home prices, resulting in a $50.2 billion overvaluation in Florida's housing market, according to a recent study published in Nature. "In many parts of the US — and particularly coastal counties, but also in parts of Appalachia as well — housing markets are not efficiently pricing flood risk into home values and that's causing this housing bubble to occur," Jesse Gourevitch, one of the study's authors and an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, told Business Insider. "In Florida, there's really high flood risk, which I think is broadly understood, but that the cost associated with that flood risk is not being captured in home values." Instead, there may be "localized downsizings" as certain areas develop a stigma after particularly bad storms, explains Ryan D'Amario, a vice president of personal lines property underwriting at insurance analytics firm Verisk. But predicting exactly when and where an extreme weather event is likely to happen is so "broad and wide" that many homeowners are likely to continue with business as usual. Advertisement "The storms are happening so diversely in so many different areas of the state," D'Amario told Business Insider. "The demand will always be present." Smith-Frady, the real-estate agent whose Bradenton home flooded, said part of living in Florida is understanding the tradeoff between risk and reward. "We live in a great place — it's wonderful," Smith-Frady said. "We haven't had a storm surge on this part of the Gulf Coast in over 100 years. It's easy for generations to forget that you're susceptible to that. But the reality is that that is the risk that we take by living on the coast."

Mainland China remains closed for the week-long national holiday until tonight. It is worth noting that India rebounded from its intra-day lows once other Asian markets closed, indicating India could be a funding source for the China re-rating trade. Hong Kong bounced around the room in the morning, but grinded higher as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced that Director Zheng Zhajie and several Deputy Directors will host a press conference tomorrow at 10 am to review the “implementation of a package of incremental policies to solidly promote the economic structure to improve and development trend to continue to improve”. We’ve seen the monetary, housing, and stock market policy bazooka unleased, but with very little fiscal stimulus thus far, except subsidies for auto and home appliance purchases. The press conference should provide further clarity on fiscal measures. The rock band Imagine Dragon’s popular song titled “Whatever It Takes” is what the Chinese government is committed to doing to get the economy, consumer confidence, and domestic consumption higher. Over the weekend, a Mainland brokerage noted the government fiscal stimulus will be “a gradual strategy” versus “an immediate large-scale expansion” as they expect “the initial expansion scale will be about 2 trillion yuan of additional bonds, which will be used to support the trade-in of consumer goods, strengthen social security benefits, and help local governments repay their debts.” Based on economic data and government policy meetings at month-end, December’s Chinese Economic Working Conference, and next year’s Two Sessions, there are multiple opportunities for the government to press the gas pedal, as necessary. Skepticism about the Chinese government’s ability to improve the economy was cited in a Bloomberg News article on the topic. CLSA and Goldman Sachs equity strategists are the only two firms that have upgraded their China model weights thus far. Moving the sentiment supertanker will take time, which means more buyers will likely be forced to come back into the space in the coming months, quarters, and years. Train data indicates a strong National Holiday, with 17 million passengers taking trips on each of the last six days. Meanwhile, Macau hotel occupancy rates were 95% during the holiday. Hong Kong was led higher by growth stocks and sectors, though it was another broad rally, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, which were Tencent, which gained +0.17%, Alibaba, which gained +0.61%, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), which gained +21.76%, Meituan, which fell -0.09%, and Hong Kong Exchanges, which gained +4.68%. Tomorrow’s China reopening should be fun to watch! Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks have a limit-up of 10%, which means trading will be halted once the market is up by that amount, while the STAR Board has a limit-up of 20%.

Advertisement Call it superstitious, but Mark Zhu, a 34-year-old managing director at Blackstone, likes to start every day the same way. He has two Trader Joe's yogurt cups, one banana-flavored and one blueberry-flavored, eaten in the same order, followed by his supplements, which also have their specific sequence. "Those are just examples of how I bring a level of consistency and sequencing to my life," he said. "Because you know the moment after 9 o'clock, the days can get chaotic." Similarly, the 90 minutes between 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. are precious to Craig Kolwicz. The Moelis investment banker uses that time to put himself in control for the rest of the day, whether by going to the gym, meditating, or reading a book. Advertisement "You're not getting pulled in all different directions with your deals, your transactions, or just things in life," said the 35-year-old managing director. "It's sacred time to me — anything before 7 a.m. is my time." It's no secret that working on Wall Street is demanding. Finance giants from Blackstone to Goldman Sachs attract some of the brightest and most driven people, and to climb the ranks is no easy feat. When we asked top up-and-comers on Wall Street about the habits or routines they followed to keep themselves mentally sharp, no one mentioned cold plunges , 10-step facial rituals, or biohacking trends that tout themselves as life hacks that instantly make you more attractive, healthier, smarter, and more balanced. Advertisement Most of these high performers featured on Business Insider's 2024 list of rising stars of Wall Street are spending time with their families, keeping physically and mentally healthy with reasonable workout and sleep routines , and finding opportunities to recharge. Here's what we learned about the hacks, habits, and routines that help top talent on Wall Street stay on their game. Morning routines Chicago-based Bank of America investment banker Corey White is another early riser. He relies on his Apple watch to wake him up gently, with a little vibration at 5 a.m. The 35-year-old works out. He's partial to weight lifting but recently took up running thanks to his twin brother, who works in private equity. He sends his kids off to school and listens to a podcast on an hour-long commute into the office. "My mornings are super important to me to have a nice, kind of slow start to the day. And I found it's regulating," he told BI. The routine helps him stay present with his home life as well as work, he added.

Nina Gnedin, a portfolio manager at the largest public hedge fund, Man Group. Man Group "I wake up. I do my face. I do my skincare. I brush my teeth. I drink my double shot of espresso. I do all my morning work rituals, where I check the trades. I check on the portfolios around 7, 7:30. I get coffee again." Her "very regimented" workday ends at 3 p.m., which allows her to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. "There's no day of the year where the sun's down when I'm done with work," she said. Productivity hacks and habits Bridgewater Associates deputy chief investment officer Blake Cecil likes to push himself (and his team) to meet deadlines that might be arbitrary on paper but give him a mental goal to chase. Advertisement The 32-year-old overpromises on projects intentionally to " trick" himself into working more efficiently and diligently. One example is he will ask his team and himself this hypothetical: "Let's imagine we had to deliver this in 24 hours — how would we do that?" Often, this leads to creative and innovative work, he told BI. BlackRock's Chi Chen, 34, winds down her weekends with a Sunday evening reading ritual that helps her "distill my brain." It's a two-hour affair, starting with one hour of the books she's reading. The fixed-income portfolio manager is a fan of non-fiction and just read "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky. After that, she turns back to the markets. She reads external and internal research and prepares for the week. Advertisement Commuting with a purpose Since starting at Bank of America, Justin Elliott has had a daily regimen designed to take up his 20-minute commute to work. Related stories "It's really around my faith — I do a devotion. Read a Bible scripture, pray. Come into the office and listen to a gospel song," the 29-year-old vice president on the institutional rates sales desk at Bank of America told BI. "That's my every morning routine for getting me centered for the day. It's about reminding me why I'm here and what it's all about." He also goes to the gym two to three times a week and has recently been doing sound baths and meditation with his wife. Listening to music on her drive to her Boston office helps Fidelity Investments' Palmer Osteen, 31, take her mind off what's about to come and what's ahead so she can start her workday with a clear head.

KKR KKR's Alissa Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley but now lives in New York, uses the time to touch base with family and friends. "It just keeps me connected to the people I care about," the 31-year-old industrials investor told BI. "I've been doing this since my college internships." "Part of it is just that we came to the US when I was really young, and so here it's just the four of us here, my two parents and my brother. And so we're really close," she added. "That's been a way that I've kept in touch." Advertisement Friends and Family Similarly, making time for quality time with friends and family keeps Daniela Cardona, 29, grounded. "I work a ton," the RBC investment banking vice president said, but "most important is I've never lost sight of my friends, my support system." Bank of America's White has a family day every Saturday with his wife and two young sons. "We go to the museums, go to the zoo, go to the water park, wherever it is, we just fully, deeply focus on our family," he said. "And I think being able to give 100% to whatever you're focused on is really important for just productivity, but also for the mental side of I'm here right now in the moment with my family and being fully immersed in that." Advertisement Hobbies that help take you away Ben Carper, who finished his Padi open water certification a couple of years ago, tries to take a trip or two a year with his wife that focuses on diving. Along with a chance to see exotic locations, it's a chance to completely unplug. "It's a change of scenery, and it's kind of hard to think about work when there's a 25-foot manta ray swimming nearby," Carper, a 34-year-old managing director on Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory team, added. His last dive was in the Maldives, and he's eyeing Thailand next. Matthew Eid-Holm, a principal at Ares Management, skis or scuba dives at least every 6 months. "A few hours of these activities that require 100% focus on the present are very effective at resetting," the 32-year-old told BI. Advertisement Kolwicz, a managing director at the boutique investment bank Moelis. Moelis Also, on the ocean theme, Moelis' Kolwicz is a pretty avid surfer. "Being out on the ocean, getting that physical activity — it's easy to zone out." There are ways to decompress and relax on land, too. Melissa Ding, an infrastructure investor at BlackRock, likes to engage in meditative activities like cooking, pottery, or tending to her terrace garden to give the 33-year-old a "little bit of mental reset." "When I need a little bit of rest time, there are just things that I do that where I can kind of zone out." Advertisement Her garden consists of flowers, including dahlias, and a recently planted fig tree. Wells Fargo's Annie Cheslin, 34, recently learned how to play the centuries-old strategy game mahjong, which she's become "obsessed with." The managing director in high-grade municipal trading joined a club that meets twice a month to play. Related stories Exercise routines Physical challenges are a way to distract yourself from the day-to-day and counterbalance the time you spend in front of computer screens or client dinners. Margaret Williams, a 31-year-old executive director at Morgan Stanley, said she exercises in some form or fashion every day. Williams will do anything, from a run in Central Park to weightlifting to laps at a hotel pool on the road to late-night walks with the dog. Advertisement "It's a part of staying balanced, physically and mentally," she said. Being disciplined about daily workouts is also how Apollo's Austin Anton, 32, clears his head. "I find that when I go for a run, I have my most creative ideas, and I love to run, and I tend to do that every other day," he said. "So I find that very helpful in terms of clearing my head and allowing me to think through something." Erica Wilson, a credit underwriter at Blue Owl Capital Blue Owl Erica Wilson's workout of choice is weightlifting, which "has become a real stress reliever over the last couple of years," she told BI. Advertisement The 31-year-old vice president at Blue Owl's daily habit has evolved into a competitive hobby. She participated in a power-lifting competition last year through Tone House — she deadlifted nearly twice her body weight — as well as Hyrox, a fitness race featuring eight separate physical exercises, such as sled pulls or burpee broad jumps, with a 1-kilometer run in between each. For Harrison DiGia, morning is the best time to get a workout in. "I try to wake up and move my body. I do some sort of workout every morning, whether it's strength training, playing tennis, or even stretching or yoga," the 31-year-old General Atlantic vice president said. "I'm a huge tennis player. I like using that time in the morning to clear my mind. It helps me reset and gets me ready for the new day ahead." Getting some shut-eye Patrick Lenihan, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, has a strict bedtime. Advertisement "There's some nights where you need to get things done, but I try to have a hard cutoff. Let's just say 9:30— that's lights out." That gives him 30 or 45 minutes to wind down and ensure he gets his sleep, not just for physical health, but mental, too. He also makes a point to stay active. He played hockey his whole life, but after a few surgeries, he now does lower-impact exercises like pilates and barre at least three or four times a week. "Now that I'm on paternity leave, I've been lucky enough to do it, get in a little bit more. But I think those two things help me to at least stay recharged and stay ready each day," he said. Luckily, his infant son is a great sleeper and has not disturbed Patrick's rest so far. Advertisement "I definitely think getting sleep is important," Elizabeth Stone Redding, a principal at TPG, told BI. "It's certainly something I have realized as I've matured in my career, that you really need to use your brain, and you need to get a decent amount of sleep for that." The 33-year-old also habitually sets priorities to stay on track and not get overwhelmed. "It's very easy to obviously be overwhelmed with a large list of things, but narrowing it down and saying, 'Okay, these are the two or three things I really want to do today,' helps me a lot," Stone Redding said. "I try to have — even if it's just in my head — a list of two or three things I want to accomplish in a given day." Taking a step back Matt Gilbert, a 35-year-old managing director at Thoma Bravo, started working with an executive coach a few years ago. He was surprised when the coach pushed him to pull back at work. Advertisement "I would say, in general, workaholic or 'Type A' people tend to try to grasp more and more responsibility," he said. "And I actually think ultimately that was the case for me." Gilbert now spends more time with his family. He has made a habit of watching TV with his wife every night and dropping his oldest daughter at school. "I think I fill up my cup in terms of personal fulfillment so that my time that I'm at work, I can really, really focus and dedicate to that and kind of maximize the time that I have here."

While venture capital-backed startups grab headlines with massive funding rounds, a new breed of companies is emerging as the true backbone of the continent's innovation ecosystem: bootstrapped startups. In an exclusive interview with the Managing Partner of a leading tech M&A advisory boutique specialized in small and midcap transactions, he shares insights on how in his experience these self-funded ventures are proving that sustainable growth, profitability, and innovation can go hand in hand, often outperforming their VC-backed counterparts in the long run. The Numbers Game On the surface, European venture capital appears to be thriving. According to Dealroom, European startups raised a record €100 billion in 2021 and although it dropped to € 63 billion in 2023 , this figure would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. However, beneath this glittering façade lies a more complex and troubling reality, especially for scaleups. "We have so many clients coming to us who built great companies with a range in revenues of two, three million" reveals Stefan Köppl , Managing Partner of Samira Advisors , a leading tech M&A advisory boutique. "But they burnt several millions on the way in VC money because from the very beginning they were used to 'Okay, my investors will pay me anyway.'" This scenario, repeated across countless startups, points to a fundamental issue: the misalignment between VC funding models and the natural growth trajectories of most businesses. Whereas venture capital is the perfect financing method for a specific subset of high-growth companies in rapidly advancing markets, a lot of companies in a more conservative environment would be better suited to grow more capital efficiently and/or finance their development with different financial instruments. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor The Power Of Bootstrapping "We're seeing a surge in highly successful bootstrapped companies across Europe," Köppl begins. "These companies are building sustainable businesses with real revenue and profits in a highly capital efficient way, often outpacing VC-backed startups in terms of long-term viability." While venture capital remains an important part of the ecosystem, Köppl argues that the success of bootstrapped companies is challenging the notion that massive funding rounds are necessary for startup success. "We worked with dozens of bootstrapped companies that have grown to €5-10 million in annual recurring revenue with lean teams of 20-30 employees. They're often profitable from day one and have complete control over their destiny and the pace in which they reach it." A Tale Of Two Approaches Köppl shares an illuminating example that highlights the potential of bootstrapped companies: "We recently worked with a bootstrapped software company.They started in a garage five years ago and had grown to double digit million in annual recurring revenue with just 28 employees. They were profitable from month six and had complete control over their product roadmap and company culture. When they decided to explore acquisition options, they had seven serious bidders and ultimately sold for 8x revenue, a multiple that many VC-backed companies struggle to achieve. Furthermore, the founder could choose between potential acquirers not just based on how much they pay but even more on how he perceives the acquirer to fit to his company, also in cultural terms." This success story stands in stark contrast to some VC-backed companies that struggle to find exits despite raising significant capital. Köppl points out, "How many really large strategic M&As are happening in Europe per year, over 200 million? Very few. And when they do happen, the terms are often not favorable to founders due to complex cap tables and liquidation preferences." The Advantages Of Bootstrapping According to Köppl, bootstrapped companies enjoy several key advantages: Focus on Revenue : "When you're bootstrapped, every euro counts. These companies become laser-focused on what truly adds value for customers. They operate by the motto: You can only eat what you kill." Efficient Operations : "Limited resources encourage creativity and efficiency. I've seen bootstrapped startups outperform well-funded competitors simply because they've optimized every aspect of their operations." Customer-Centric Approach : "Without the pressure to achieve hypergrowth, bootstrapped startups can focus on delivering real value to customers. Their entire roadmap is driven by customer needs, not investor expectations." Flexibility: "I've seen bootstrapped companies completely reinvent themselves in a matter of weeks to seize new opportunities. That kind of agility is much harder when you have a board to convince." Attractive to Acquirers: "When we look at acquisition targets, bootstrapped companies often have cleaner financials, more rational valuations, and a proven ability to operate efficiently. It makes the due diligence process smoother and increases the likelihood of a successful integration." The Human Factor Beyond the financial benefits, Köppl observes that bootstrapping often leads to a healthier work environment for founders and employees alike. "The founders who build sustainable, bootstrapped companies often end up much happier," he notes. "They're building on their own terms, without the constant pressure of raising the next round.Top-tier VCs already recognized this and are avoiding founders who are not genuinely up for this game. This approach also allows for a more diverse range of startups to flourish. Köppl explains, "Not every great idea needs to be a potential unicorn. Bootstrapping enables entrepreneurs to build valuable businesses in niche markets that might be overlooked by VC funds. We're seeing incredible innovation in areas like vertical SaaS, where bootstrapped companies are dominating niche industries. " Challenges And Solutions While bootstrapping offers many advantages, Köppl acknowledges it's not without challenges. Limited resources can slow growth, and some industries require significant upfront capital that self-funding can't provide. However, he points out that innovative solutions are emerging: Revenue-Based Financing : "We're seeing new financial products that allow companies to access growth capital based on their revenue, rather than equity. It's allowing these companies to accelerate growth without giving up control." Angel Syndicates: "Smaller investments from groups of angel investors can provide capital without the strings attached to VC funding. It's a way for successful entrepreneurs to support the next generation without the overhead of a formal VC fund." Strategic Partnerships : "One of our clients, a bootstrapped AI company, landed a partnership with a major automotive manufacturer. It gave them access to data and resources that would have been impossible to obtain otherwise, accelerating their growth without dilution." The Role Of Public Support While private capital plays a crucial role, Köppl notes that public initiatives are also evolving to support a more diverse startup ecosystem. "It is true that there is still a strong need to boost venture capital in Europe, especially in certain regions and in the growth stage." he observes. "But at the same time, there’s a growing recognition that supporting sustainable, bootstrapped companies can have a significant positive impact on the economy." He highlights several promising initiatives: Grants for R&D: "Non-dilutive funding for innovative projects is allowing companies to invest in technology without giving up equity." Tax Incentives: "Policies that reward companies for reinvesting profits into growth and job creation are particularly beneficial for bootstrapped companies." Public-Private Partnerships: "Programs that connect bootstrapped startups with larger corporations for mentorship and potential business opportunities are creating valuable synergies." Stefan highlights that public support plays a crucial role in venture capital, but it doesn’t always align perfectly with market needs. For instance, there is a lot of capital avaliable for seed stage VC funds, despite some regional markets already having sufficient liquidity in that area. The real challenge, he notes, seems to lie more in growth stage funding than in early stage. The Road Ahead As Europe's tech ecosystem matures, Köppl believes the importance of bootstrapped companies will only grow. "The future of European innovation lies in a diverse ecosystem that celebrates different paths to success," he concludes. "Bootstrapped companies are showing us that it's possible to build world-class businesses without following the traditional VC playbook." Köppl emphasizes that there's room for both models in the ecosystem. "VC funding is crucial for certain types of businesses,but is more a niche product then it is perceived often right now. We need to recognize and celebrate the bootstrapped companies that are often the unsung heroes of European tech" As policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs look to the future, Köppl argues that embracing and supporting bootstrapped startups will be key to building a sustainable and innovative European tech sector. By celebrating these hidden champions and providing them with the resources and recognition they deserve, Europe can foster a new generation of technology leaders that compete on the global stage while staying true to their roots. The message from Köppl's insights is clear: in the world of European tech, sometimes less outside capital means more innovation, more sustainability, and ultimately, more success. As the continent continues to establish itself as a global tech powerhouse, it's the bootstrapped startups that may well lead the way, proving that with determination, creativity, and a focus on customer value, European entrepreneurs can build world-changing companies on their own terms.

Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated's (NASDAQ:CORT) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 12:41 PM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Corcept Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:CORT) stock is up by a considerable 52% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Corcept Therapeutics' ROE. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Corcept Therapeutics How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Corcept Therapeutics is: 21% = US$126m ÷ US$596m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. A Side By Side comparison of Corcept Therapeutics' Earnings Growth And 21% ROE To start with, Corcept Therapeutics' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 22%. Despite the modest returns, Corcept Therapeutics' five year net income growth was quite low, averaging at only 3.0%. A few likely reasons that could be keeping earnings growth low are - the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance. Given that the industry shrunk its earnings at a rate of 0.3% over the last few years, the net income growth of the company is quite impressive. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Corcept Therapeutics fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Corcept Therapeutics Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Corcept Therapeutics doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. However, this doesn't explain the low earnings growth the company has seen. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect.

A Look At The Fair Value Of Hock Lian Seng Holdings Limited (SGX:J2T) Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Oct 6, 2024, 3:10 AM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights The projected fair value for Hock Lian Seng Holdings is S$0.42 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With S$0.35 share price, Hock Lian Seng Holdings appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Hock Lian Seng Holdings Limited ( SGX:J2T ) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model . See our latest analysis for Hock Lian Seng Holdings Step By Step Through The Calculation We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (SGD, Millions) S$16.1m S$13.2m S$11.7m S$10.8m S$10.3m S$10.0m S$9.89m S$9.88m S$9.93m S$10.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -26.33% Est @ -17.78% Est @ -11.80% Est @ -7.61% Est @ -4.68% Est @ -2.63% Est @ -1.19% Est @ -0.19% Est @ 0.52% Est @ 1.01% Present Value (SGD, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% S$15.1 S$11.7 S$9.7 S$8.4 S$7.6 S$6.9 S$6.4 S$6.1 S$5.7 S$5.4 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = S$83m The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = S$10m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = S$247m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = S$247m÷ ( 1 + 6.3%) 10 = S$134m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is S$217m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of S$0.3, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hock Lian Seng Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Hock Lian Seng Holdings Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Currently debt free. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Construction market. Opportunity Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine J2T's earnings prospects. Threat No apparent threats visible for J2T. Next Steps: Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Share on Facebook Post Share to Flipboard Email Show more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Pin it Submit to Reddit Post to Tumblr Share on WhatsApp Print This Page Hollywood may be grappling with painful change but for Roeg Sutherland , co-Head of CAA’s Media Finance department and its International Film Group, the disruption represents an opportunity for the independent film sector that he has supported for the past two decades. “If there’s true disruption in the marketplace, it means that not enough movies are being made by the studios. There are still slots to fill and there’s always someone who wants to watch a movie,” Sutherland told the Zurich Summit on Saturday. “If the studios are making less movies, that means we get to make more movies, and then we get to sell them. There’s a real opportunity for us to have a real impact on the market.” Related Stories Festivals Fabrice Du Welz Discusses True Crime Marc Dutroux Affair Thriller 'Maldoror' & Influence Of Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood' News Zurich Film Festival 2024 Winners -- Full List Sutherland was speaking in an onstage conversation at the Zurich Film Festival ’s annual industry conflab ahead of receiving its Game Changer Award, celebrating his work getting hundreds of movies over the line . Speaking to FilmNation Entertainment Founder and CEO Glen Basner and Deadline’s Co-Editor-in-Chief Film Mike Fleming Jr, Sutherland gave a candid and lively insight into his journey to becoming one of the key movers and shakers in the independent film financing world. He revealed he had never been tempted to follow his parents, Donald Sutherland and Francine Racette (who was in the audience), or half-brother Kiefer Sutherland into acting. Brothers Rossif and Angus are also actors. Aside from a self-described lack of talent for acting, he said his late father’s attitude to the process of moviemaking had also played its part. “My father would always say, ‘As an actor, you give 100% of yourself’… he refused to watch his movies, because he felt like only 50% of what he would give was actually on the screen,” said Sutherland. “That was interesting to me, I realized that I was much more interested in controlling the whole, rather than controlling the part. So that was my way of justifying not acting, even though I would have never gotten a job as an actor.” His roster of jobs before finding his calling at CAA, ranged from movie PA to film editor and an extremely brief stint as stand-in for Marlon Brando. “That lasted all of 35 seconds,” he recalled of the latter gig, revealing Brando had kicked him off the set for talking while the actor was trying to learn his lines between takes. It was bruising experience, given Brando had been one of his life long idols, in an admiration instilled in him by his mother. Sutherland credited his father’s agent Ron Meyer with giving him his first break in CAA’s legendary mailroom. “It felt a little strange. My parents didn’t particularly love agents. Growing up, the community of actors and artists around them weren’t at dinner, shall we say, celebrating agents,” he recalled. “I thought they were sending me to prison, but it turned out to be the best experience I ever had in my life.” Even then, Sutherland said, it took him time to find his “spot” at the agency. “I was supposed to be in the talent department, but I was not a natural fit. And truly what we do, the independent, international stuff, didn’t really start until around 2005, or at least, didn’t start to flourish, because everything was being made by studios,” he explained. “I was thrown into a department that was mostly a servicing department for clients who had a project that they wanted to do when they weren’t working on a big studio movie. But then the business evolved after the economic crisis in 2006 and a lot more of these movies were left to people like us to go figure out financing on.” Some two decades later, CAA Media Finance is the go-to for many producers trying to put together an elevated independent project. Glen Basner, Roeg Sutherland and Mike Fleming Jr at the Zurich Summit Long-time collaborator Basner suggested 60 to 70% of the independent films successfully released over the past 20 years, had been supported in some shape or form by Sutherland and the Media Finance team. Sutherland runs the division with fellow Co-Head Ben Kramer, also a perennial figure at major festivals and markets and who steers the dealmaking and operations with Sutherland. “That’s maybe true,” Sutherland said of Basner’s estimate, “but it doesn’t come from our group, it comes from our clients and we’re lucky to represent some of the best people in the world that give us the ability to deliver the packages that you finance. We’re great middlemen.” None of it would be possible without long-time trusted financing partners such as Basner, AGC Studios CEO Stuart Ford or international sales maverick Vincent Maraval, he added. “Our purpose is to make sure there’s a healthy ecosystem in the marketplace, to make sure that we take care of our clients and that we set up movies in an appropriate way, that not only respects their needs and their desires, but also the needs and desires of the film financing community with international distributors and whoever may be financing,” said Sutherland. “Sometimes it’s worldwide deals. For the most part, it’s piecemeal, with a foreign sales agent being part of it, and selling off international territories, bringing in an equity investor, making sure that the equity investor is in a safe position if they go into making a movie without having distribution in place.” Sutherland said pulling together the finance for early films in his career such as Darren Aronofsky’s The Wrestler , starring Mickey Rourke, and Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker , had been part of his learning process. “When you’re that young and don’t know how anything works, and kind of learning on the fly, you just kind of trust the process. You don’t over complicate and overthink things,” he said. The Wrestler, ©Copyright Twentieth Century Fox. Courtesy Everett Collection “Vincent Maraval told me, ‘We’re going do The Wrestler .’ I’m like, ‘Okay, we’re going to do The Wrestler .’ Now, I would ask him about 400 questions about how much he can pre-sell, how much we’re going to be able to borrow against the territories that he doesn’t presell, and where am I going to be able to find them at four o’clock in the morning when we need to sign a deal?” A big part of the learning curve, said Sutherland, was learning to roll with the punches that arise in the process of pulling a project together. “It’s like the movie Force Majeure . The avalanche is going to show up at some point in time, and then it’s a question of whether you run off the balcony or, you stay there and protect your family,” he said. Looking back at the raft of films CAA Media Finance has helped to bring to fruition over the past two decades, Sutherland said he and his team would never seek to take credit for a film’s existence. “We help the community get the tools to understand how to sell it, but it doesn’t happen because of us. Take Black Swan , very difficult movie to set up, but its genius is Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of help to get people to understand what the director’s vision is and for them to connect with it. But ultimately, we’re just facilitators.” He suggested that Black Swan had gotten lost in translation in the conversations between the director and the financiers. The issue had been that the screenplay read like a drama, while Aronofsky’s vision was for it to be a psychological thriller. “It wasn’t on the page, so people didn’t see it automatically. They’re like, ‘Is he going to tell us it’s a thriller and then deliver a drama?” recalled Sutherland. He filled the gap in the budget through producer Brian Oliver, who had raised $8 million from Louisiana-based investors at the time. “He’s like, ‘Roeg, I’m going to make four horror movies.’ And I’m like, ‘No, you’re not, you’re going to do Black Swan ,” recalled Sutherland. “That worked well for him,” he added, saying Oliver had made $70 million on the back of his investment, after the film grossed $329 million worldwide. Looking at more recent history, Basner recalled how Sutherland had spearheaded the virtual Cannes market, with Maraval, when the physical festival had been shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. “What were we supposed to do? Lick our wounds and say, ‘Oh God, the business is dead. We can’t create content’,” he said. “People were stuck at home. We had to figure out a way to get movies made. There’d never been a better time for us to sell movies. The only way we could do that was to create these virtual markets.” “We would have weekly phone calls with 500 people on it. We were like, ‘How are we going to reorganize ourselves, and how are we going to make it exciting?,” he said. Sutherland added that the success of the initiative had been down to the fact that the entire independent community had come together. “The only way that we succeed is when we work together. When we work against each other, nothing good happens. When my entire team comes together and works with the entire independent community and we all come together, that’s when we’re successful.” Roeg Sutherland at the Zurich Summit James Gorman Named Chairman; Iger’s Successor To Be Announced In Early 2026 CAA Gears Up For End-Of-Year Staff Cuts; Rumor Mill Churning Tom Holland Circling Lead Role In Christopher Nolan’s Next Event Film At Universal Edward Berger On Why Ralph Fiennes Was Only Choice For ‘Conclave’ Read More About: Comments Subscribe to Deadline Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The strategist upgraded his 12-month target for the benchmark to 6,300 points from 6,000, implying gains of about 10% from current levels. “We continue to believe we’re in a ‘good is good’ environment in terms of the equity market’s response to the labor/economic growth data,” Wilson wrote in a note. “The bond market is becoming less skeptical on the soft landing outcome, an important signal for equity investors.” US stocks have rebounded after a selloff over the summer on fading recession concerns and the Fed’s policy easing. Traders expect the central bank to reduce rates by another 100 basis points by May, according to swaps data. Sentiment was also boosted Friday as the payrolls figure came in much stronger than expected. Wilson said the setup bodes well for smaller US stocks, which stand to benefit from improving business activity and sentiment, as well as lower investor positioning. The strategist eased his long-standing bet on large caps, citing a dimmer risk-reward over the short term. Among sectors, Wilson upgraded his view on financials to overweight, and downgraded health care and consumer staples. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reports earnings on Friday, providing an update on the profitability of lenders and officially kicking off the earnings season.

Private Equity Ruins Tech Companies | Zachary Hamed The Wordpress and open source communities have lots of thoughts on Matt Mullenweg’s actions after his talk at WordCamp . Much of this commentary has overlooked what I think is a core concern at the heart of Matt’s argument: the growing role and influence of private equity in tech, particularly in open source. PE firms raise money from institutional investors and high net worth individuals to buy companies, restructure them, and sell them later for a profit. They’re all about maximizing returns ASAP, usually in a 3-7 year window. That’s a shorter timeframe than the typical founder or public company shareholder, and far shorter than Matt’s time horizon : I would like future generations to grow up with a web that is more open, more free, gives more liberty, and so open source is really my life’s work, even above WordPress and anything else. I hope to work on it the rest of my life. When a PE firm acquires a tech company, a few things happen. The new owners focus on aggressive cost-cutting and “streamlining” operations to boost short-term profitability. This is extremely destructive, leading to mass layoffs, reduced benefits, and wholesale outsourcing. At the same time, PE firms often load up acquired companies with debt, extracting cash while leaving the businesses more financially unstable. With a myopic focus on an exit, long-term investments in innovation, customer service, and employee development fall by the wayside. The result? Private equity backed companies are 10 times more likely to go bankrupt than public companies. The basic business model of private equity firms often leads to disasters like that at ManorCare for three fundamental reasons. First, private equity firms typically buy businesses only for the short term. Second, they often load up the companies they buy with debt and extract onerous fees. And third, they insulate themselves from the consequences, both legal and financial, of their actions. This leads to a practice of extraction, rather than investment, of destruction, rather than creation. While not every company owned by private equity firms goes bankrupt, the chance of disaster meaningfully increases under their ownership. — Plunder by Brendan Ballou Open source communities are particularly vulnerable to this model. They’re delicate ecosystems of volunteer contributors, transparent governance, and values-aligned sponsorships. Applying the PE playbook can easily destabilize that entire balance. Take, for example, Vista Equity Partners' $1 billion acquisition of Acquia in 2019. Acquia is the main commercial backer of Drupal, another popular open source CMS. In the years since the acquisition, the Drupal community has visibly struggled. Acquia appears to be contributing less code and providing less financial support to the ecosystem. Just a few days ago, Acquia quietly laid off almost a third of its staff . With fewer resources, core development and maintenance have slowed. This coincides with a sharp decline in Drupal’s market share compared to competitors like WordPress: The Drupal story demonstrates how applying PE tactics to open source projects can undermine their health and sustainability. By nature, these communities aren’t a fit for rapid extraction of outsized returns. Their vitality depends on reinvestment, transparency, and long-term stability — the opposite of the PE model. Toys “R” Us . Simon & Schuster . Even America’s ports . Not everyone can push back against private equity, but I believe we should support companies like Wordpress that have a long history of admirable values and prescient leadership. Wordpress powers more than 40% of the web — its community’s health is too important to ignore. Zachary Hamed @zmh

European Investment Bank crafts new funding plan to keep startups in the EU Skip to content Save over 40% when you secure your tickets today to TNW Conference 💥 Prices will increase on November 22 → The European Investment Bank (EIB) is considering new measures to help close the funding gap for European startups and prevent them from relocating across the Atlantic. During a meeting with EU finance ministers yesterday in Luxembourg, the EIB proposed its “Action Plan” that aims to boost Europe’s capital markets, investments, and competitiveness. A key pillar of the plan is to increase support for the EU’s venture capital and private equity markets to enable the scaling up of innovative startups and unicorns. This includes three different measures, starting with the extension of the European Tech Champions Initiative (ETCI). Launched in 2023, the ETCI is a fund of funds that provides late-stage capital to European companies. By February 2024, it had closed €1bn of investments . The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! The EIB also plans to boost equity and venture debt investments for scaleups and it will work towards the creation of a new exit platform to facilitate acquisitions and public listings for tech startups. “The Action Plan discussed with ministers will help European innovators scale up their business and contribute to channel savings into productive investments,” EIB Group President Nadia Calviño said in a statement. Calviño added that the measures will foster innovation and job creation, ultimately “ensuring that European companies born in Europe, stay in Europe.” Europe’s innovation gap EIB’s proposed plan comes a month after Mario Draghi sounded the alarm about the EU’s inability to commercialise innovations. In a report commissioned by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, Draghi warned that the bloc is significantly falling behind competitors such as the US. “The problem is not that Europe lacks ideas or ambition,” the Italian former premier said. “But innovation is blocked at the next stage: we are failing to translate innovation into commercialisation.” According to the report, only four European companies rank among the world’s top 50 tech giants. Furthermore, no EU-based tech company has achieved a market capitalisation exceeding €100 billion in the past half-century. This starkly contrasts with the US, which boasts six such companies valued at over €1 trillion. To further illustrate the EU’s challenges, the report also showed that, between 2008 and 2021, nearly one third of European unicorns relocated abroad, with the majority moving to the US.

Here’s what to know before you decide. J Studios/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption J Studios/Getty Images Mortgage rates have dropped significantly in recent months, and that means one thing for those who bought a home in the last couple years: It might be time to refinance. Refinancing your mortgage means swapping your current interest rate for a new one. This is typically done if rates have fallen a good amount since you took out a home loan or last refinanced. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now just above 6%, down a full point from where it was in May. Most homeowners won’t feel the need to do anything. Nearly 60% of Americans with mortgages have rates below 4%. But if you bought recently at a higher rate, you could now be in a position to cut your monthly payment significantly. Sponsor Message Even small changes in rates can make a big difference, says Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency. “Now that rates have been falling, we project that millions of people can save big money every month if they're able to refinance,” he says. For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, you'd save $329 on the monthly payment with a 6% versus a 7% rate. Interested in seeing if you can save money on your mortgage? Here’s what to know about refinancing – and how to think about timing. J Studios/Getty Images Get a sense of how much you could save The first step is to do some online research to get a rough idea of how a lower rate could change your monthly payment. You’ll also want to: Calculate your refinance rate. Websites like Bankrate, Nerdwallet and Rocket Mortgage have pages where you can enter basic data like your zip code, credit score range and how much you owe on your loan, and they’ll spit out sample refinance rates from various lenders. This will give you a more specific idea of the sort of rates you might be able to get. Calculate your break-even point. Plug your rate into an online refinance calculator to get a sense of your break-even point: how long you would need to own the home before the savings from refinancing outweigh the costs of refinancing. If you’re planning on selling your home soon, it might not make sense to refinance. Sponsor Message Refinancing does cost money: expect to pay several thousand dollars in closing costs, as you did when you first bought the home. Benjamin Balser, a mortgage broker in Alexandria, Va., says refinance costs for a typical home in Washington, D.C., tend to start at about $2,000, while in Virginia, they’re upward of $3,000. Keep in mind that these online calculators are only giving you an estimate. To get results tailored to you, you’ll need to reach out to some mortgage brokers and loan officers. Which brings us to the next step. Life Kit 8 Tips That Will Help You Save Money On A Mortgage Shop around for the best rate When you refinance, you could stick with your current lender or go to a new one. The new lender pays off your old mortgage when you take out your new loan. To get the best rate, shop around for quotes. Ask your friends, coworkers and neighbors to connect you to their lender and get rates from them. Getting the best rate is partly a numbers game, says Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac. “Even identical borrowers applying on the same day with the same lender will often get different rates – and it's hard to figure out why,” he says. “You just have to make sure you get enough quotes, because one of them may come in that's lower than the others.” We Are/Getty Images One possible alternative: a mortgage reset There’s also an alternative to refinancing that may be available, depending on your lender: a mortgage reset. Some banks and credit unions allow you to reset your mortgage rate to the current market rate, often for a flat fee, without having to jump through the hoops of a refinance. Ask your lender if this is an option, because it won’t be for all mortgages. Refinancing means a new loan with new possibilities People often refinance to lower their monthly mortgage payment. But there are other reasons you may want to go through this process. Sponsor Message To move from an adjustable rate mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage. Borrowers who have a variable rate may want to lock in a rate they know they can manage. To borrow money. Some people who have built up equity in their home opt to do what’s called a cash-out refinance, where they take out a larger loan than what they currently owe on their property.This allows them to take out cash by tapping into their home equity. This is commonly done to pay for home renovation projects as an alternative to using a home equity line of credit (HELOC). A cash-out refinance can also be used to pay down other debt at a higher rate.This type of refinance comes with risk. It means taking out a bigger loan, and it reduces the equity you have in your home. Consider the loan term you want Because refinancing means taking out a new loan, the loan term can be changed. If you are two years into paying off your 30-year mortgage, you have 28 years left on it. But if you take out a new 30-year loan, you’re starting the 30-year clock over again. That can be a little dispiriting. If your financial situation has improved or the new lower rates make it possible, you could see about moving to a shorter-term loan, like 15, 20 or 25 years. A shorter term means paying off your mortgage faster and paying less total interest. Ask potential lenders what terms are possible, and assess what your monthly payment would be.

Should you go for it as soon as it’s clear it’ll save you money? Or should you wait to see if rates drop further? Your decision to refinance depends on your personal circumstances as a borrower, for example, how long you intend to own the home. But if the numbers are in your favor now, Khater says he’d go for it. Sponsor Message “Forecasting rates is very difficult. There's a lot of turbulence, both in the financial markets and in geopolitics that could drive rates higher from here. From my perspective, I would take the opportunity and pull the trigger.” In other words, if you can save $300 a month by refinancing now, he says you might as well hedge your bets and do it. If rates fall another full percentage point, you could always refinance again later. And you may not realize this, but as a homeowner, you’re already paying for the option to refinance. It’s baked into the mortgage rate you’re paying -- the risk to your lender that you may decide to refinance your loan someday. So take advantage of it if it can save you money.

Transition to a circular bioeconomy requires getting prices right | ScienceDaily Science News from research organizations Transition to a circular bioeconomy requires getting prices right Study outlines key pathways to a circular system for food and energy production -- including incentives that put a price on waste Date: October 8, 2024 Source: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment Summary: A circular bioeconomy that reduces and recycles waste, transitions away from fossil fuels to renewable bio-based alternatives, and regenerates natural systems is critical for feeding and fueling the world's growing population in environmentally sustainable ways. But it's a complicated concept, and significant questions remain about how it should be implemented and how to get buy-in from farmers, industry, and consumers in a market economy. A new paper by noted agricultural economists and scientists argues that the concept of a circular bioeconomy needs to expand beyond its technical focus on reducing waste and incorporate a values-based economic lens. The authors emphasize the need for the right policies, incentives, and market signals to persuade consumers and producers to make environmentally sound decisions -- and to help ensure that the system is equitable. Share: Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIN Email FULL STORY Conventional food and agricultural production systems employ a linear "take, make, waste" approach: taking natural resources from the Earth to make food and fuel, generating waste that contaminates the soil and water, and emitting harmful pollutants. More recently, a new model of production is gaining traction in the scientific and business community: a "circular bioeconomy" that reduces and recycles waste, transitions away from fossil fuels to renewable bio-based alternatives, and regenerates natural systems. This approach is critical for feeding and fueling the world's growing population in environmentally sustainable ways. But it's a complicated concept, and significant questions remain: How should waste reduction be implemented? How far should we go in being "circular," considering its costs and benefits? And how can a circular bioeconomy system get buy-in from farmers, industry, and consumers in a market economy? A new paper by noted agricultural economists and scientists argues that the concept of a circular bioeconomy needs to expand beyond its technical focus on reducing waste and incorporate a values-based economic lens. The authors emphasize the need for the right policies, incentives, and market signals to persuade consumers and producers to make environmentally sound decisions -- and to help ensure that the system is equitable. "Zero waste is an appealing goal, but we also need to consider the economic consequences of achieving this goal -- the cost, who bears it, and how we get people to implement it. This requires us to not just focus on the environmental benefits of reducing waste and fossil fuel use, but to think about what level of waste is acceptable considering economic and equity goals as well as how we make the transition by inducing consumers and producers to make the right choices," said lead author Madhu Khanna, ACES Distinguished Professor in Environmental Economics and Alvin H. Baum Family Chair & Director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Charting the path to a circular bioeconomy will require creative ideas from researchers in multiple disciplines, including social scientists, to understand human behavior and design the right kinds of incentives, Khanna said. The paper, published in Communications Earth and Environment was co-authored with David Zilberman, University of California, Berkeley; Gal Hochman, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Bruno Basso, Michigan State University. A circular bioeconomy provides a framework for reducing waste and improving sustainability throughout the economy, Khanna said. It aims to not only reduce environmental contamination associated with agricultural production, but also transform the energy sector, plastics manufacturing, and other industries by using agricultural waste as a resource that can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and decarbonize the economy. The authors incorporated those concepts into an economic framework to help determine the optimal level of circularity in a market economy. They recommend five critical pathways to enable the transition: Technological advances through investment in research and development, to lower the cost of climate-smart and clean energy innovations. Regulatory incentives that put a price on waste and environmental damage, such as a carbon tax, and institutional changes like crop insurance programs that lower the risk of adopting sustainable practices for farmers. Robust markets for circular products. Public education and awareness about the ecosystem benefits of a circular bioeconomy. Equity considerations for displaced workers and consumers vulnerable to high prices. Researchers have made great strides developing individual technologies that contribute to a circular bioeconomy in food and agriculture -- such as precision farming and digital agricultural technologies that can increase the efficiency with which chemicals are utilized for crop production, and advances in synthetic biology to convert plants and waste materials into biofuels and biochemicals, replacing petroleum-based, carbon dioxide-emitting energy sources. But many of these technologies are expensive. More investment is needed to scale them and make them commercially competitive and affordable for farmers and consumers, the authors said. One underlying question in designing eco-friendly policies is how to create the right incentives for people to adopt sustainable technology -- and how to put a value on the most effective approaches. The challenge with agricultural pollution, for example, is that it's difficult to measure and pinpoint the source of runoff or other contaminants. New tools like a "digital twin" -- a computer replica of a field -- can help calculate the environmental impact of agricultural management practices, such as adding nitrogen to the soil. Those kinds of advances can lead to targeted policies that reward farmers for results, rather than providing costly uniform payments for participation in conservation programs, The overall solution will require action by the public and private sector, according to the authors. Many corporations are already adopting sustainable practices, and many consumers are willing to pay a higher price for organic foods and sustainably sourced products. Still, those efforts fall far short of what is needed to curb climate change or reduce pollutants that cause hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. New government incentives, and changes in the way pollution is regulated, are necessary, Khanna said. Educating consumers can change their preferences and willingness to pay for climate-smart commodities, creating market demand and political support. "If consumers don't demand enough of it, and aren't willing to pay, the producer is not going to produce it," Khanna said. The move to circular bioeconomy must be accompanied by social programs that shield vulnerable low-income consumers from higher prices in the short term, and provide new training for workers who may lose jobs as the fossil fuel industry declines, the authors said. The next step will be to develop more interdisciplinary research programs where economists work with engineers and scientists to apply this framework to specific industries or supply chains, to determine what a transition to a circular bioeconomy would look like for that sector. "We are excited that we are establishing a new Center in iSEE to catalyze that kind of research," Khanna said, referring to the new Levenick Center for a Climate-Smart Circular Bioeconomy at Illinois. The transition to a circular bioeconomy will require a long-term policy commitment, consistent policies, and investments that could take a decade or more to pay off, Khanna said. "We are significantly falling short of meeting both our U.S. and global targets for carbon emissions reduction. Additionally, other environmental issues such as water quality degradation and biodiversity loss are worsening. It is crucial to recognize that these environmental problems are interconnected, ranging from air and water pollution to plastic waste," Khanna said. "These issues all stem from the same source: our current methods of production and consumption. Instead of addressing these problems individually, transitioning to a circular bioeconomy offers a holistic solution."

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Oct 7, 2024, 12:36pm EDT Updated Oct 9, 2024, 03:04pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin China Last Night KraneShares Key News Asian equities were higher, despite a stronger US dollar due to rising US Treasury yields, except for India. Mainland China remains closed for the week-long national holiday until tonight. It is worth noting that India rebounded from its intra-day lows once other Asian markets closed, indicating India could be a funding source for the China re-rating trade. Hong Kong bounced around the room in the morning, but grinded higher as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced that Director Zheng Zhajie and several Deputy Directors will host a press conference tomorrow at 10 am to review the “implementation of a package of incremental policies to solidly promote the economic structure to improve and development trend to continue to improve”. We’ve seen the monetary, housing, and stock market policy bazooka unleased, but with very little fiscal stimulus thus far, except subsidies for auto and home appliance purchases. The press conference should provide further clarity on fiscal measures. The rock band Imagine Dragon’s popular song titled “Whatever It Takes” is what the Chinese government is committed to doing to get the economy, consumer confidence, and domestic consumption higher. Over the weekend, a Mainland brokerage noted the government fiscal stimulus will be “a gradual strategy” versus “an immediate large-scale expansion” as they expect “the initial expansion scale will be about 2 trillion yuan of additional bonds, which will be used to support the trade-in of consumer goods, strengthen social security benefits, and help local governments repay their debts.” Based on economic data and government policy meetings at month-end, December’s Chinese Economic Working Conference, and next year’s Two Sessions, there are multiple opportunities for the government to press the gas pedal, as necessary. Skepticism about the Chinese government’s ability to improve the economy was cited in a Bloomberg News article on the topic. CLSA and Goldman Sachs equity strategists are the only two firms that have upgraded their China model weights thus far. Moving the sentiment supertanker will take time, which means more buyers will likely be forced to come back into the space in the coming months, quarters, and years. Train data indicates a strong National Holiday, with 17 million passengers taking trips on each of the last six days. Meanwhile, Macau hotel occupancy rates were 95% during the holiday. Hong Kong was led higher by growth stocks and sectors, though it was another broad rally, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, which were Tencent, which gained +0.17%, Alibaba, which gained +0.61%, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), which gained +21.76%, Meituan, which fell -0.09%, and Hong Kong Exchanges, which gained +4.68%. Tomorrow’s China reopening should be fun to watch! Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks have a limit-up of 10%, which means trading will be halted once the market is up by that amount, while the STAR Board has a limit-up of 20%. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +1.60% and +3.05%, respectively, on volume that increased +13.5% from Friday, which is 266% of the 1-year average. 448 stocks advanced, while 60 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased 40% from Friday, which is 248% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small caps outperformed the value factor and large caps. All sectors were positive, except for Real Estate, which fell -0.02%. The market was led higher by Information Technology, which gained +5.46%, Industrials, which gained +4.84%, and Utilities, which gained +4.45%.

Advertisement Call it superstitious, but Mark Zhu, a 34-year-old managing director at Blackstone, likes to start every day the same way. He has two Trader Joe's yogurt cups, one banana-flavored and one blueberry-flavored, eaten in the same order, followed by his supplements, which also have their specific sequence. "Those are just examples of how I bring a level of consistency and sequencing to my life," he said. "Because you know the moment after 9 o'clock, the days can get chaotic." Similarly, the 90 minutes between 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. are precious to Craig Kolwicz. The Moelis investment banker uses that time to put himself in control for the rest of the day, whether by going to the gym, meditating, or reading a book. Advertisement "You're not getting pulled in all different directions with your deals, your transactions, or just things in life," said the 35-year-old managing director. "It's sacred time to me — anything before 7 a.m. is my time." It's no secret that working on Wall Street is demanding. Finance giants from Blackstone to Goldman Sachs attract some of the brightest and most driven people, and to climb the ranks is no easy feat. When we asked top up-and-comers on Wall Street about the habits or routines they followed to keep themselves mentally sharp, no one mentioned cold plunges , 10-step facial rituals, or biohacking trends that tout themselves as life hacks that instantly make you more attractive, healthier, smarter, and more balanced. Advertisement Most of these high performers featured on Business Insider's 2024 list of rising stars of Wall Street are spending time with their families, keeping physically and mentally healthy with reasonable workout and sleep routines , and finding opportunities to recharge. Here's what we learned about the hacks, habits, and routines that help top talent on Wall Street stay on their game. Morning routines Chicago-based Bank of America investment banker Corey White is another early riser. He relies on his Apple watch to wake him up gently, with a little vibration at 5 a.m. The 35-year-old works out. He's partial to weight lifting but recently took up running thanks to his twin brother, who works in private equity. He sends his kids off to school and listens to a podcast on an hour-long commute into the office. "My mornings are super important to me to have a nice, kind of slow start to the day. And I found it's regulating," he told BI. The routine helps him stay present with his home life as well as work, he added. Advertisement Nina Gnedin, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager from Man Group, starts her day at 4:30 a.m. because she works East Coast market hours. Nina Gnedin, a portfolio manager at the largest public hedge fund, Man Group. Man Group "I wake up. I do my face. I do my skincare. I brush my teeth. I drink my double shot of espresso. I do all my morning work rituals, where I check the trades. I check on the portfolios around 7, 7:30. I get coffee again." Her "very regimented" workday ends at 3 p.m., which allows her to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. "There's no day of the year where the sun's down when I'm done with work," she said. Productivity hacks and habits Bridgewater Associates deputy chief investment officer Blake Cecil likes to push himself (and his team) to meet deadlines that might be arbitrary on paper but give him a mental goal to chase. Advertisement The 32-year-old overpromises on projects intentionally to " trick" himself into working more efficiently and diligently. One example is he will ask his team and himself this hypothetical: "Let's imagine we had to deliver this in 24 hours — how would we do that?" Often, this leads to creative and innovative work, he told BI. BlackRock's Chi Chen, 34, winds down her weekends with a Sunday evening reading ritual that helps her "distill my brain." It's a two-hour affair, starting with one hour of the books she's reading. The fixed-income portfolio manager is a fan of non-fiction and just read "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky. After that, she turns back to the markets. She reads external and internal research and prepares for the week. Advertisement Commuting with a purpose Since starting at Bank of America, Justin Elliott has had a daily regimen designed to take up his 20-minute commute to work. Related stories "It's really around my faith — I do a devotion. Read a Bible scripture, pray. Come into the office and listen to a gospel song," the 29-year-old vice president on the institutional rates sales desk at Bank of America told BI. "That's my every morning routine for getting me centered for the day. It's about reminding me why I'm here and what it's all about." He also goes to the gym two to three times a week and has recently been doing sound baths and meditation with his wife. Listening to music on her drive to her Boston office helps Fidelity Investments' Palmer Osteen, 31, take her mind off what's about to come and what's ahead so she can start her workday with a clear head. It also works for her way home. Advertisement Music "helps me reset and decompress and not go to bed with a hamster wheel in my brain," she said. Alissa Song, a principal at private equity firm KKR. KKR KKR's Alissa Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley but now lives in New York, uses the time to touch base with family and friends. "It just keeps me connected to the people I care about," the 31-year-old industrials investor told BI. "I've been doing this since my college internships." "Part of it is just that we came to the US when I was really young, and so here it's just the four of us here, my two parents and my brother. And so we're really close," she added. "That's been a way that I've kept in touch." Advertisement Friends and Family Similarly, making time for quality time with friends and family keeps Daniela Cardona, 29, grounded. "I work a ton," the RBC investment banking vice president said, but "most important is I've never lost sight of my friends, my support system." Bank of America's White has a family day every Saturday with his wife and two young sons. "We go to the museums, go to the zoo, go to the water park, wherever it is, we just fully, deeply focus on our family," he said. "And I think being able to give 100% to whatever you're focused on is really important for just productivity, but also for the mental side of I'm here right now in the moment with my family and being fully immersed in that." Advertisement Hobbies that help take you away Ben Carper, who finished his Padi open water certification a couple of years ago, tries to take a trip or two a year with his wife that focuses on diving. Along with a chance to see exotic locations, it's a chance to completely unplug. "It's a change of scenery, and it's kind of hard to think about work when there's a 25-foot manta ray swimming nearby," Carper, a 34-year-old managing director on Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory team, added. His last dive was in the Maldives, and he's eyeing Thailand next. Matthew Eid-Holm, a principal at Ares Management, skis or scuba dives at least every 6 months. "A few hours of these activities that require 100% focus on the present are very effective at resetting," the 32-year-old told BI. Advertisement Kolwicz, a managing director at the boutique investment bank Moelis. Moelis Also, on the ocean theme, Moelis' Kolwicz is a pretty avid surfer. "Being out on the ocean, getting that physical activity — it's easy to zone out." There are ways to decompress and relax on land, too. Melissa Ding, an infrastructure investor at BlackRock, likes to engage in meditative activities like cooking, pottery, or tending to her terrace garden to give the 33-year-old a "little bit of mental reset." "When I need a little bit of rest time, there are just things that I do that where I can kind of zone out." Advertisement Her garden consists of flowers, including dahlias, and a recently planted fig tree. Wells Fargo's Annie Cheslin, 34, recently learned how to play the centuries-old strategy game mahjong, which she's become "obsessed with." The managing director in high-grade municipal trading joined a club that meets twice a month to play. Related stories Exercise routines Physical challenges are a way to distract yourself from the day-to-day and counterbalance the time you spend in front of computer screens or client dinners. Margaret Williams, a 31-year-old executive director at Morgan Stanley, said she exercises in some form or fashion every day. Williams will do anything, from a run in Central Park to weightlifting to laps at a hotel pool on the road to late-night walks with the dog. Advertisement "It's a part of staying balanced, physically and mentally," she said. Being disciplined about daily workouts is also how Apollo's Austin Anton, 32, clears his head. "I find that when I go for a run, I have my most creative ideas, and I love to run, and I tend to do that every other day," he said. "So I find that very helpful in terms of clearing my head and allowing me to think through something." Erica Wilson, a credit underwriter at Blue Owl Capital Blue Owl Erica Wilson's workout of choice is weightlifting, which "has become a real stress reliever over the last couple of years," she told BI. Advertisement The 31-year-old vice president at Blue Owl's daily habit has evolved into a competitive hobby. She participated in a power-lifting competition last year through Tone House — she deadlifted nearly twice her body weight — as well as Hyrox, a fitness race featuring eight separate physical exercises, such as sled pulls or burpee broad jumps, with a 1-kilometer run in between each. For Harrison DiGia, morning is the best time to get a workout in. "I try to wake up and move my body. I do some sort of workout every morning, whether it's strength training, playing tennis, or even stretching or yoga," the 31-year-old General Atlantic vice president said. "I'm a huge tennis player. I like using that time in the morning to clear my mind. It helps me reset and gets me ready for the new day ahead." Getting some shut-eye Patrick Lenihan, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, has a strict bedtime. Advertisement "There's some nights where you need to get things done, but I try to have a hard cutoff. Let's just say 9:30— that's lights out." That gives him 30 or 45 minutes to wind down and ensure he gets his sleep, not just for physical health, but mental, too. He also makes a point to stay active. He played hockey his whole life, but after a few surgeries, he now does lower-impact exercises like pilates and barre at least three or four times a week. "Now that I'm on paternity leave, I've been lucky enough to do it, get in a little bit more. But I think those two things help me to at least stay recharged and stay ready each day," he said. Luckily, his infant son is a great sleeper and has not disturbed Patrick's rest so far. Advertisement "I definitely think getting sleep is important," Elizabeth Stone Redding, a principal at TPG, told BI. "It's certainly something I have realized as I've matured in my career, that you really need to use your brain, and you need to get a decent amount of sleep for that." The 33-year-old also habitually sets priorities to stay on track and not get overwhelmed. "It's very easy to obviously be overwhelmed with a large list of things, but narrowing it down and saying, 'Okay, these are the two or three things I really want to do today,' helps me a lot," Stone Redding said. "I try to have — even if it's just in my head — a list of two or three things I want to accomplish in a given day." Taking a step back Matt Gilbert, a 35-year-old managing director at Thoma Bravo, started working with an executive coach a few years ago. He was surprised when the coach pushed him to pull back at work. Advertisement "I would say, in general, workaholic or 'Type A' people tend to try to grasp more and more responsibility," he said. "And I actually think ultimately that was the case for me." Gilbert now spends more time with his family. He has made a habit of watching TV with his wife every night and dropping his oldest daughter at school. "I think I fill up my cup in terms of personal fulfillment so that my time that I'm at work, I can really, really focus and dedicate to that and kind of maximize the time that I have here." Gidan Dan, a senior vice president of fixed-income sales at market maker Citadel Securities. Citadel Securities Gidan Dan's key ritual at work is consistently staying in touch with his clients, but at home, the Citadel Securities senior vice president takes the chance to relax.

Advertisement US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after Monday's losses, with momentum revived by a tech rally and falling crude prices. The Magnificent 7 tech cohort led the market higher, with Nvidia at the forefront. The AI chipmaker climbed 4% on Tuesday, while Meta , Tesla , and Microsoft all traded more than 1% higher. The surge in oil prices that pressured stocks on Monday, meanwhile, retraced, with international and US crude prices falling more than 4%. Energy traders pulled back on Monday as they continued to await retaliation from Israel over Iran's missile barrage last week, while a disappointing stimulus update in China weighed on the outlook for oil demand. In the US, Wall Street is keeping an eye on the upcoming consumer price index report for September. The inflation data will publish on Thursday, and will inform investors what to expect from the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in November. Advertisement Though the market had been anticipating another half-point interest rate cut next month, last Friday's big jobs report erased those forecasts. Bank of America expects any upside surprise in the inflation data may keep rates higher for longer . At the same time, Fed officials have cited optimistic expectations for rate cuts to continue. On Monday, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times that a quarter-point cut is a "very good base case." Economists project consumer inflation for September to come in at 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in August. Tuesday's session also marked the start of earnings season. In a new report, BofA noted that the bar for third-quarter earnings is low , adding that investors will likely reward firms as long as they express confidence about lower rates. Advertisement Major US financial firms, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, report results on Friday. Among Tuesday's notable movers was Roblox, which briefly fell nearly 10% in intraday trading, after short-seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the gaming platform. Meanwhile, China's sharp equity rally showed signs of slowing down . Beijing's failure to announce new stimulus plans on Tuesday has disappointed investors. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Tuesday: Advertisement S&P 500 : 5,751.16, up 0.97% Dow Jones Industrial Average : 42,080.37, up 0.3% (+126.13 points) Nasdaq composite : 18,182.92, up 1.45% Here's what else is going on: Energy traders bet Hurricane Milton will spark power outages and leave power plants idling in Florida. Russia's economy can withstand pressure for several more years but will eventually face an "unsolvable trilemma," an expert says. Rate cuts were supposed to ease mortgage rates. Here's why the opposite happened. China's stimulus won't stop its GDP decline next year , the World Bank says.

European Investment Bank crafts new funding plan to keep startups in the EU Skip to content Save over 40% when you secure your tickets today to TNW Conference 💥 Prices will increase on November 22 → The European Investment Bank (EIB) is considering new measures to help close the funding gap for European startups and prevent them from relocating across the Atlantic. During a meeting with EU finance ministers yesterday in Luxembourg, the EIB proposed its “Action Plan” that aims to boost Europe’s capital markets, investments, and competitiveness. A key pillar of the plan is to increase support for the EU’s venture capital and private equity markets to enable the scaling up of innovative startups and unicorns. This includes three different measures, starting with the extension of the European Tech Champions Initiative (ETCI). Launched in 2023, the ETCI is a fund of funds that provides late-stage capital to European companies. By February 2024, it had closed €1bn of investments . The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! The EIB also plans to boost equity and venture debt investments for scaleups and it will work towards the creation of a new exit platform to facilitate acquisitions and public listings for tech startups. “The Action Plan discussed with ministers will help European innovators scale up their business and contribute to channel savings into productive investments,” EIB Group President Nadia Calviño said in a statement. Calviño added that the measures will foster innovation and job creation, ultimately “ensuring that European companies born in Europe, stay in Europe.” Europe’s innovation gap EIB’s proposed plan comes a month after Mario Draghi sounded the alarm about the EU’s inability to commercialise innovations. In a report commissioned by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, Draghi warned that the bloc is significantly falling behind competitors such as the US. “The problem is not that Europe lacks ideas or ambition,” the Italian former premier said. “But innovation is blocked at the next stage: we are failing to translate innovation into commercialisation.” According to the report, only four European companies rank among the world’s top 50 tech giants. Furthermore, no EU-based tech company has achieved a market capitalisation exceeding €100 billion in the past half-century. This starkly contrasts with the US, which boasts six such companies valued at over €1 trillion. To further illustrate the EU’s challenges, the report also showed that, between 2008 and 2021, nearly one third of European unicorns relocated abroad, with the majority moving to the US.

Hudson Technologies, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HDSN) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 5:28 PM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: With its stock down 8.2% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Hudson Technologies' ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Hudson Technologies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hudson Technologies is: 15% = US$37m ÷ US$249m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Hudson Technologies' Earnings Growth And 15% ROE At first glance, Hudson Technologies seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Hudson Technologies' exceptional 54% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. As a next step, we compared Hudson Technologies' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 25%. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Hudson Technologies''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Hudson Technologies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Hudson Technologies doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above. Summary In total, we are pretty happy with Hudson Technologies' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more. Have feedback on this article?

Mortgage rates have dropped. Should you refinance your home? : NPR Accessibility links Skip to main content Keyboard shortcuts for audio player Mortgage rates have dropped. Should you refinance your home? Interested in seeing if you can save money on your mortgage? Here’s what to know about refinancing – and how to think about timing. Mortgage rates have dropped. Should you refinance your home? October 8, 2024 1:25 PM ET Laurel Wamsley How to refinance your mortgage Listen · 17:10 17:10 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed < iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/g-s1-26348/g-s1-26933" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player"> As interest rates have dropped, refinancing could make sense, or not. Here’s what to know before you decide. J Studios/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption J Studios/Getty Images Mortgage rates have dropped significantly in recent months, and that means one thing for those who bought a home in the last couple years: It might be time to refinance. Refinancing your mortgage means swapping your current interest rate for a new one. This is typically done if rates have fallen a good amount since you took out a home loan or last refinanced. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now just above 6%, down a full point from where it was in May. Most homeowners won’t feel the need to do anything. Nearly 60% of Americans with mortgages have rates below 4%. But if you bought recently at a higher rate, you could now be in a position to cut your monthly payment significantly. Sponsor Message Even small changes in rates can make a big difference, says Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency. “Now that rates have been falling, we project that millions of people can save big money every month if they're able to refinance,” he says. For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, you'd save $329 on the monthly payment with a 6% versus a 7% rate. Interested in seeing if you can save money on your mortgage? Here’s what to know about refinancing – and how to think about timing. J Studios/Getty Images Get a sense of how much you could save The first step is to do some online research to get a rough idea of how a lower rate could change your monthly payment. You’ll also want to: Calculate your refinance rate. Websites like Bankrate, Nerdwallet and Rocket Mortgage have pages where you can enter basic data like your zip code, credit score range and how much you owe on your loan, and they’ll spit out sample refinance rates from various lenders. This will give you a more specific idea of the sort of rates you might be able to get. Calculate your break-even point. Plug your rate into an online refinance calculator to get a sense of your break-even point: how long you would need to own the home before the savings from refinancing outweigh the costs of refinancing. If you’re planning on selling your home soon, it might not make sense to refinance. Sponsor Message Refinancing does cost money: expect to pay several thousand dollars in closing costs, as you did when you first bought the home. Benjamin Balser, a mortgage broker in Alexandria, Va., says refinance costs for a typical home in Washington, D.C., tend to start at about $2,000, while in Virginia, they’re upward of $3,000. Keep in mind that these online calculators are only giving you an estimate. To get results tailored to you, you’ll need to reach out to some mortgage brokers and loan officers. Which brings us to the next step. Life Kit 8 Tips That Will Help You Save Money On A Mortgage Shop around for the best rate When you refinance, you could stick with your current lender or go to a new one. The new lender pays off your old mortgage when you take out your new loan. To get the best rate, shop around for quotes. Ask your friends, coworkers and neighbors to connect you to their lender and get rates from them. Getting the best rate is partly a numbers game, says Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac. “Even identical borrowers applying on the same day with the same lender will often get different rates – and it's hard to figure out why,” he says. “You just have to make sure you get enough quotes, because one of them may come in that's lower than the others.” We Are/Getty Images One possible alternative: a mortgage reset There’s also an alternative to refinancing that may be available, depending on your lender: a mortgage reset. Some banks and credit unions allow you to reset your mortgage rate to the current market rate, often for a flat fee, without having to jump through the hoops of a refinance. Ask your lender if this is an option, because it won’t be for all mortgages. Refinancing means a new loan with new possibilities People often refinance to lower their monthly mortgage payment. But there are other reasons you may want to go through this process. Sponsor Message To move from an adjustable rate mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage. Borrowers who have a variable rate may want to lock in a rate they know they can manage. To borrow money. Some people who have built up equity in their home opt to do what’s called a cash-out refinance, where they take out a larger loan than what they currently owe on their property.This allows them to take out cash by tapping into their home equity. This is commonly done to pay for home renovation projects as an alternative to using a home equity line of credit (HELOC). A cash-out refinance can also be used to pay down other debt at a higher rate.This type of refinance comes with risk. It means taking out a bigger loan, and it reduces the equity you have in your home. Consider the loan term you want Because refinancing means taking out a new loan, the loan term can be changed. If you are two years into paying off your 30-year mortgage, you have 28 years left on it. But if you take out a new 30-year loan, you’re starting the 30-year clock over again. That can be a little dispiriting. If your financial situation has improved or the new lower rates make it possible, you could see about moving to a shorter-term loan, like 15, 20 or 25 years. A shorter term means paying off your mortgage faster and paying less total interest. Ask potential lenders what terms are possible, and assess what your monthly payment would be.

Should you go for it as soon as it’s clear it’ll save you money? Or should you wait to see if rates drop further? Your decision to refinance depends on your personal circumstances as a borrower, for example, how long you intend to own the home. But if the numbers are in your favor now, Khater says he’d go for it. Sponsor Message “Forecasting rates is very difficult. There's a lot of turbulence, both in the financial markets and in geopolitics that could drive rates higher from here. From my perspective, I would take the opportunity and pull the trigger.” In other words, if you can save $300 a month by refinancing now, he says you might as well hedge your bets and do it. If rates fall another full percentage point, you could always refinance again later. And you may not realize this, but as a homeowner, you’re already paying for the option to refinance. It’s baked into the mortgage rate you’re paying -- the risk to your lender that you may decide to refinance your loan someday. So take advantage of it if it can save you money.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years Read full article Neha Gupta Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 7:22 AM 9 min read Link Copied 3 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. Economic Resilience and Surprising Rate Cut Amid Geopolitical Tensions The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows . Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” Story continues Which Stocks Could Make You Rich in 5 to 10 Years? When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Pixabay/Public Domain Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing.

Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years Read full article Neha Gupta Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 7:28 AM 7 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. Economic Resilience and Surprising Rate Cut Amid Geopolitical Tensions The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows . Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” Story continues Which Stocks Could Make You Rich in 5 to 10 Years? When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ).

Advertisement Founded by a group of former OpenAI employees, Anthropic has emerged as a serious contender in the race for AI dominance. The flagship product is Claude , an AI chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT . Anthropic has sought to position itself as the safer, more stable alternative to OpenAI, and a company that risk-averse Fortune 500 companies can feel comfortable doing business with. That differentiation has only become more relevant as OpenAI continues to be mired in chaos and infighting. Anthropic has raised over $7 billion over the past year from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce and is reportedly raising a new round of funding that could value the company at as much as $40 billion, according to The Information. Business Insider has put together a list of the most important people running Anthropic right now. The list is by no means exhaustive, but it includes thought leaders and researchers who are contributing knowledge to the understanding of machine learning, as well as the business people working to build Anthropic into an AI behemoth. Advertisement Dario Amodei, Co-Founder and CEO Before leaving to start Anthropic, Amodei served as vice president of research at OpenAI where he led the development of breakthrough large language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3. His foundational research on reinforcement learning and scaling laws helped revolutionize the AI industry. Since its founding, Amodei has helped establish Anthropic as the safer, more business-friendly alternative to his former employer, OpenAI. Dario holds a Ph.D. in biophysics and computational neuroscience from Princeton University, where he was a Hertz Fellow. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Stanford University School of Medicine, focusing on applying machine learning to biomedical data. Daniela Amodei, Co-Founder and President Advertisement After her career in international development, Amodei was in charge of risk management and compliance at Stripe before serving as vice president of safety and policy at OpenAI. She's been in the trenches working to create sager, steerable, and reliable AI since the early days of this nascent industry. She, along with her brother Dario, was part of the team that left OpenAI with the goal of creating a more responsible AI company. Today, she oversees Anthropic's day-to-day operations and has been instrumental in shaping the company's defining ethos around safety and security. Jack Clark, Co-Founder and Head of Policy Clark made a name for himself as a journalist at Bloomberg, where he was quite possibly the world's first and, for a while only, neural networks reporter. Advertisement He would go on to serve as policy director at OpenAI and now leads a team at Anthropic that produces research into AI bias and persuasion and conducts critical red-teaming that pushes the boundaries of understanding around AI-related risk. He has proven himself to be one of AI's most eloquent thought leaders, and his newsletter, Import AI, has become required reading for anyone interested in tackling big questions in machine learning. Jared Kaplan, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer Related stories Kaplan, who boasts a PhD from Harvard, spent 15 years as a theoretical physicist in academia and continues to lecture on deep learning at Johns Hopkins University. While at OpenAI, he helped create GPT-3 and Codex, and his revolutionary work on AI scaling laws has been foundational for the entire AI industry. Kaplan helped pioneer Constitutional AI, an approach championed by Anthropic that aims to create AI systems that are constrained by and aligned with a set of predetermined principles. Advertisement Chris Olah, Co-Founder and Research Lead, Mechanistic Interpretability Olah is a researcher in the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is essentially the science of translating neural networks into algorithms that are useful to humans. Olah's research focuses on mapping out the artificial "neurons" that are part of AI models. His team achieved a significant milestone earlier this year by successfully identifying distinct neuron clusters within Anthropic's most advanced models that are associated with specific concepts and tasks, such as detecting bias or identifying fraudulent emails. By selectively activating or deactivating these neuron groups, the team demonstrated the ability to modulate the model's behavior. Advertisement Sam McCandlish, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer McCandlish oversees Anthropic's Large Language Model (LLM) Organization, which encompasses the Training, Inference, and Core Resources divisions. He also serves as the company's Responsible Scaling Officer, helping design and implement Anthropic's responsible scaling policy . McCandlish was a former research lead at OpenAI, where he spearheaded AI Safety initiatives and pioneered scaling laws that influenced technological breakthroughs like GPT-3. He holds a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Stanford University, specializing in quantum gravity and tensor networks, and an MS in Physics from Brandeis University, where he explored active matter to quantum field theory. Tom Brown, Co-Founder and Head of Core Resources Advertisement Brown was part of the technical staff at OpenAI and Google DeepMind, and, like Anthropic's other founders, his research, particularly his work on how computational power influences model performance, has helped lay the groundwork for the entire AI industry. At Anthropic, Brown is focused on the compute side of LLM development, overseeing the company's use of scarce, valuable GPUs and leading its strategic partnerships with cloud and chip providers. Brown is also an alum of the legendary tech incubator Y Combinator. Krishna Rao, Chief Financial Officer As any emerging AI company can attest, conducting groundbreaking research isn't enough. Anthropic, like most of its competitors, is also tackling the challenge of building a viable, profitable global business. Rao, who was hired in May as the company's first CFO, is helping to formulate Anthropic's financial strategy during a period of explosive growth. Advertisement He cut his teeth working at private equity giant Blackstone and management consultant Bain & Company before becoming head of business development at Airbnb. In that role, he helped the company raise billions in private capital and steered the company through its high-profile IPO. Mike Krieger, Chief Product Officer A native of São Paulo, Krieger joined Anthropic as Chief Product Officer in May 2024. He currently leads the global product team, collaborating closely with customers across industries to shape the product vision and strategy for Anthropic's flagship model, Claude. In this role, he's building deep relationships with users and helping to turn Anthropic's research into a mass-market product. Advertisement He is a cofounder of Instagram and served as its CTO, where he grew the engineering organization to more than 450 employees across the company's offices in Menlo Park, San Francisco, and New York. Brian Israel, General Counsel As generative AI opens up new avenues for technological innovation, it's also raising fraught questions about authenticity, creativity, and some of the core assumptions of our legal system. Like many of its competitors, Anthropic is deeply enmeshed in these questions, whether that's helping to guide the creation of new legal frameworks or facing lawsuits that could determine to future of the nascent AI industry. Israel is the point person helping Anthropic navigate this legal landscape. Before joining Anthropic, Brian spent nearly a decade in the US government, from the State Department to NASA, working to address the legal challenges created by emerging technologies. Advertisement Sam Bowman, Alignment Bowman co-leads Anthropic's alignment team along with Jan Leike, a safety researcher who recently left OpenAI. The team is responsible for confronting some of the thorniest questions associated with the development of advanced AI models. It works on forecasting when AI models will develop potentially dangerous abilities like deception or scheming and how humans will be able to tell when they do. The alignment team is also developing evaluations that can flag when a model reaches a concerning level of skill and reliable techniques for controlling them when they get out of line. These capabilities are essential to Anthropic's positioning of itself as the safer AI company.

Transition to a circular bioeconomy requires getting prices right | ScienceDaily Science News from research organizations Transition to a circular bioeconomy requires getting prices right Study outlines key pathways to a circular system for food and energy production -- including incentives that put a price on waste Date: October 8, 2024 Source: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment Summary: A circular bioeconomy that reduces and recycles waste, transitions away from fossil fuels to renewable bio-based alternatives, and regenerates natural systems is critical for feeding and fueling the world's growing population in environmentally sustainable ways. But it's a complicated concept, and significant questions remain about how it should be implemented and how to get buy-in from farmers, industry, and consumers in a market economy. A new paper by noted agricultural economists and scientists argues that the concept of a circular bioeconomy needs to expand beyond its technical focus on reducing waste and incorporate a values-based economic lens. The authors emphasize the need for the right policies, incentives, and market signals to persuade consumers and producers to make environmentally sound decisions -- and to help ensure that the system is equitable. Share: Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIN Email FULL STORY Conventional food and agricultural production systems employ a linear "take, make, waste" approach: taking natural resources from the Earth to make food and fuel, generating waste that contaminates the soil and water, and emitting harmful pollutants. More recently, a new model of production is gaining traction in the scientific and business community: a "circular bioeconomy" that reduces and recycles waste, transitions away from fossil fuels to renewable bio-based alternatives, and regenerates natural systems. This approach is critical for feeding and fueling the world's growing population in environmentally sustainable ways. But it's a complicated concept, and significant questions remain: How should waste reduction be implemented? How far should we go in being "circular," considering its costs and benefits? And how can a circular bioeconomy system get buy-in from farmers, industry, and consumers in a market economy? A new paper by noted agricultural economists and scientists argues that the concept of a circular bioeconomy needs to expand beyond its technical focus on reducing waste and incorporate a values-based economic lens. The authors emphasize the need for the right policies, incentives, and market signals to persuade consumers and producers to make environmentally sound decisions -- and to help ensure that the system is equitable. "Zero waste is an appealing goal, but we also need to consider the economic consequences of achieving this goal -- the cost, who bears it, and how we get people to implement it. This requires us to not just focus on the environmental benefits of reducing waste and fossil fuel use, but to think about what level of waste is acceptable considering economic and equity goals as well as how we make the transition by inducing consumers and producers to make the right choices," said lead author Madhu Khanna, ACES Distinguished Professor in Environmental Economics and Alvin H. Baum Family Chair & Director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Charting the path to a circular bioeconomy will require creative ideas from researchers in multiple disciplines, including social scientists, to understand human behavior and design the right kinds of incentives, Khanna said. The paper, published in Communications Earth and Environment was co-authored with David Zilberman, University of California, Berkeley; Gal Hochman, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Bruno Basso, Michigan State University. A circular bioeconomy provides a framework for reducing waste and improving sustainability throughout the economy, Khanna said. It aims to not only reduce environmental contamination associated with agricultural production, but also transform the energy sector, plastics manufacturing, and other industries by using agricultural waste as a resource that can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and decarbonize the economy. The authors incorporated those concepts into an economic framework to help determine the optimal level of circularity in a market economy. They recommend five critical pathways to enable the transition: Technological advances through investment in research and development, to lower the cost of climate-smart and clean energy innovations. Regulatory incentives that put a price on waste and environmental damage, such as a carbon tax, and institutional changes like crop insurance programs that lower the risk of adopting sustainable practices for farmers. Robust markets for circular products. Public education and awareness about the ecosystem benefits of a circular bioeconomy. Equity considerations for displaced workers and consumers vulnerable to high prices. Researchers have made great strides developing individual technologies that contribute to a circular bioeconomy in food and agriculture -- such as precision farming and digital agricultural technologies that can increase the efficiency with which chemicals are utilized for crop production, and advances in synthetic biology to convert plants and waste materials into biofuels and biochemicals, replacing petroleum-based, carbon dioxide-emitting energy sources. But many of these technologies are expensive. More investment is needed to scale them and make them commercially competitive and affordable for farmers and consumers, the authors said. One underlying question in designing eco-friendly policies is how to create the right incentives for people to adopt sustainable technology -- and how to put a value on the most effective approaches. The challenge with agricultural pollution, for example, is that it's difficult to measure and pinpoint the source of runoff or other contaminants. New tools like a "digital twin" -- a computer replica of a field -- can help calculate the environmental impact of agricultural management practices, such as adding nitrogen to the soil. Those kinds of advances can lead to targeted policies that reward farmers for results, rather than providing costly uniform payments for participation in conservation programs, The overall solution will require action by the public and private sector, according to the authors. Many corporations are already adopting sustainable practices, and many consumers are willing to pay a higher price for organic foods and sustainably sourced products. Still, those efforts fall far short of what is needed to curb climate change or reduce pollutants that cause hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. New government incentives, and changes in the way pollution is regulated, are necessary, Khanna said. Educating consumers can change their preferences and willingness to pay for climate-smart commodities, creating market demand and political support. "If consumers don't demand enough of it, and aren't willing to pay, the producer is not going to produce it," Khanna said. The move to circular bioeconomy must be accompanied by social programs that shield vulnerable low-income consumers from higher prices in the short term, and provide new training for workers who may lose jobs as the fossil fuel industry declines, the authors said. The next step will be to develop more interdisciplinary research programs where economists work with engineers and scientists to apply this framework to specific industries or supply chains, to determine what a transition to a circular bioeconomy would look like for that sector. "We are excited that we are establishing a new Center in iSEE to catalyze that kind of research," Khanna said, referring to the new Levenick Center for a Climate-Smart Circular Bioeconomy at Illinois. The transition to a circular bioeconomy will require a long-term policy commitment, consistent policies, and investments that could take a decade or more to pay off, Khanna said. "We are significantly falling short of meeting both our U.S. and global targets for carbon emissions reduction. Additionally, other environmental issues such as water quality degradation and biodiversity loss are worsening. It is crucial to recognize that these environmental problems are interconnected, ranging from air and water pollution to plastic waste," Khanna said. "These issues all stem from the same source: our current methods of production and consumption. Instead of addressing these problems individually, transitioning to a circular bioeconomy offers a holistic solution."

Hudson Technologies, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HDSN) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 5:28 PM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: With its stock down 8.2% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Hudson Technologies' ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Hudson Technologies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hudson Technologies is: 15% = US$37m ÷ US$249m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Hudson Technologies' Earnings Growth And 15% ROE At first glance, Hudson Technologies seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Hudson Technologies' exceptional 54% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. As a next step, we compared Hudson Technologies' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 25%. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Hudson Technologies''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Hudson Technologies Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Hudson Technologies doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above. Summary In total, we are pretty happy with Hudson Technologies' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more. Have feedback on this article?

Microsoft Corp (MSFT): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years Read full article Neha Gupta Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 7:22 AM 9 min read Link Copied 3 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. Economic Resilience and Surprising Rate Cut Amid Geopolitical Tensions The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows . Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” Story continues Which Stocks Could Make You Rich in 5 to 10 Years? When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Pixabay/Public Domain Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

The moment I saw I had an email from my solar company, I knew my nightmare was about to take another unsettling turn. For weeks, I'd been wrangling with my solar dealer about the panels it had installed on my roof months earlier. I'd passed all the necessary inspections. Someone just needed to flip a switch and turn them on, and my family would finally start saving about $400 a month in electricity during the blistering summers here in Fresno, California. But Sun Solar, the redundantly named dealer, kept giving me the runaround. I nagged them so much that I eventually got a call from a supervisor who told me the company couldn't turn the panels on until it had approval from its partner, SunPower. And that email from SunPower finally confirmed my suspicions: The company, one of the biggest solar providers in the country, announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection. Advertisement I was furious. I frantically called back Sun Solar, demanding answers. The sales rep was empathetic and candid. He, too, had a lot of questions for SunPower — what did its going under mean for his business? But he didn't know any more than I did about how much longer my solar panels would remain useless. I hung up, dejected. Then I went through a tailspin of self-doubt. Why had I become a homeowner in the first place? Our apartment in New York City was tiny, but if anything happened, all I had to do was call my super. Also, how could I have missed that this company was in trouble? I'm a business journalist, after all, and I thought I'd done my research on SunPower. It was one of the oldest and most respected companies in residential solar still in operation. But after digging a bit further, I quickly learned that SunPower was far from alone. At a time when solar is most needed to stave off the climate crisis , much of the industry is cooling. Over the past few years, high interest rates have decimated demand for residential solar, resulting in layoffs (more than 17,000 in 2023 among California solar companies alone), questionable financial engineering that's been compared to the subprime-lending crisis that sparked the Great Recession, and many, many bankruptcies — more than 100 across America so far this year. Meanwhile, my solar panels have been sitting on my roof for four months, entirely unused, taunting me from above. Over another summer of record-breaking heat, my electricity bills were astronomical. As it's only getting hotter, the solar industry threatens to leave us in the dark. California's Central Valley is prime solar-power country. There's rarely a rainy day here and ample sunlight for solar panels to take in and convert to electricity. It's rare to see a house here without solar panels. But there are a few, and mine was one of them. Solar companies knew that. Advertisement Earlier this year, I'd get calls every day from solar companies eager to pitch me on getting a system installed on my house. Sales reps from companies like Sunrun would also frequently knock on my door, asking whether I would consider solar. It happened so much that my wife and I decided to post a "no soliciting" sign out front. But in the end, all that nagging worked — I was sold on the potential for savings. Getting electricity from my provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, one of the three main providers in the state, is staggeringly expensive. Since 2020, PG&E's residential-electricity rates have risen 38% after you adjust for inflation, Severin Borenstein, a professor at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, wrote in a blog post. In the past 15 months alone, PG&E has hiked its rates four times. During previous summers, when daily highs averaged over 100 degrees for weeks on end, several of my neighbors' monthly electricity bills reached nearly $1,000 — close to the average monthly rent in Fresno. I did not want that. Related stories Neither do many homeowners across America. From 2015 to 2022, residential solar installations climbed by an average of 15% a year. Some can afford to buy an entire solar system, which costs about $12,500 on average, or finance it with a loan. Often, though, homeowners enter into arrangements like power purchase agreements, in which there are no up-front costs. The company goes out and finds capital to fund the project, installs the system, and then charges a monthly rate over a 20- or 25-year lease. Over the past five years, nearly one-quarter of homeowners in California who have had solar panels installed have gone with that agreement — including me. After I called Sun Solar in March, the SunPower dealer, my solar project was in motion within a week. But as my project progressed, I missed several signs that SunPower, along with much of the solar industry, was in a downward spiral. The company lost $200 million in 2023, and 2024 was shaping up to be worse. In the months since I called Sun Solar, had my panels installed, and waited, and waited, for an update, SunPower received notice from Nasdaq that it was out of compliance for not filing forms on time, its accounting firm, Ernst & Young, resigned, and its stock cratered to less than $0.70 a share. Advertisement Gordon Johnson, the founder and CEO of the equity-research firm GLJ Research, said the solar-panel systems offered by companies like SunPower and its main rivals, Sunnova and Sunrun, rarely make any money for the companies. "Solar is extremely uneconomical," he said. Part of what makes solar attractive is the 30% federal tax credit. Homeowners are eligible for it if they buy the panels themselves. If they opt for a power purchase agreement, the solar company can claim a similar credit — a practice that has recently come under scrutiny. Johnson said many solar companies use questionable accounting practices to inflate the value of solar systems and get larger government tax credits, which they then go shop on the open market and sell to companies such as Alphabet and Meta. "This industry is rife with fraud," Johnson said. Stock analysts aren't the only ones calling the residential-solar model into question. Late last year, Forbes said an industry whistleblower had reported to the IRS that bloated tax-credit claims were widespread across the residential-solar space. In August, the Stanford professor David F. Larcker and Brian Tayan, a corporate-governance researcher at the school, published an alarming analysis titled "Solar Flare Up: Systemic Organizational Risk in the Residential Solar Industry." The authors said a cocktail of convoluted financing, tax credits, high sales commissions, and uncertain costs "have combined to create an incredibly complex industry with multiple points of potential breakdown." They cited the recent bankruptcies of the solar giants Titan Solar, iSun, SunPower, and various others "due to financial distress, changes in regulatory standards, or fraud" as harbingers for a wider collapse. The insurer Solar Insure says nearly 75% of solar installers in California are at a "high risk" of shutting down. Advertisement Some, however, remain optimistic about residential solar's long-term prospects. "The fact that SunPower went bankrupt was largely self-inflicted," Pavel Molchanov, a managing director at Raymond James, said. "There are plenty of other companies who do rooftop solar in this country that are alive and well." He pointed out that the cost of electricity from utility providers is only going to go up — the national average cost increased 11% in 2022 and 6% in 2023 — and the cost of solar equipment has become cheaper, making solar electricity an attractive option for consumers. There's also still a huge market since 95% of single-family US homes don't have solar. But among the 5% of us who do, many of us remain in purgatory, awaiting our troubled corporate sun gods to decide our fate. Related stories A few days after my deflating call with the Sun Solar sales rep, I heard from the company's vice president of sales. While he was empathetic, he made clear that there wasn't much I could do: SunPower had communicated to the company that it couldn't touch the panels on my roof, which meant I was stuck with a lifeless solar system and couldn't seek out alternatives. A couple of days later, he called me back with a couple of options: I could buy the system outright in cash, for just over $54,000 — $38,000 with the tax credit — or finance it. In response to a detailed list of questions I asked for this story, SunPower directed me to the same press release announcing it was filing for bankruptcy protection that it had sent me as a customer, adding that it would provide updates when they became available. The dealer, Sun Solar, did not respond to these questions, either. Advertisement I also reached out to California's Contractors State License Board, which regulates solar companies, asking what recourse SunPower's customers had. In an emailed statement, it said the board had "identified substantial violations or concerns related to SunPower's operations" and "initiated formal disciplinary proceedings" to revoke the company's contractor license. It added that it had received complaints about SunPower . It has forwarded the case to the state's attorney general's office. For customers, the board recommends they consult with an attorney. I still haven't decided what I'll do. But it seems ludicrous to buy a solar system that I had no intention of buying in the first place. And with the state of residential solar in limbo, it's an option I have serious doubts about. I'm reminded of this ordeal every day I return to my house and see the gleaming, useless solar panel ornaments adorning my roof. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark comedy sitcom depicting life as a millennial homeowner. Then, like a bad punchline, I pull into the garage and turn on the lights.

Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years Read full article Neha Gupta Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 7:28 AM 7 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. Economic Resilience and Surprising Rate Cut Amid Geopolitical Tensions The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows . Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” Story continues Which Stocks Could Make You Rich in 5 to 10 Years? When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ( see more details here ). Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the top technology companies, having made a name for itself in developing and supplying semiconductor devices. While Nvidia is a leader in artificial intelligence graphics, Broadcom is making a mark on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) The company is gaining traction in a growing market and currently produces the top ASICs used by businesses needing general-purpose AI chips, such as large tech companies like Meta and Alphabet. J.P. Morgan projects the addressable market for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s custom AI chips could reach $150 billion over the next four to five years, thanks to the company’s pioneering efforts in this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s business growth. More precisely, Broadcom stated in June that it was expected to sell over $11 billion worth of AI chips this year. The company’s AI-focused chip sales more than tripled to $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Not only is that incredible year-over-year growth, but Broadcom’s AI sales accounted for an impressive 24% of the company’s sales in the quarter, total revenue totalling $13.1 billion. During the earnings call, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO Hock Tan stated that “customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters” and that the demand for custom AI accelerators is still growing. As chip customers keep returning for more, the company should generate more revenue and earnings to return to shareholders. Here is what Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also performed well during the quarter, as the company reported better-than-expected earnings, with an upside from demand related to AI. This long-term holding is strongly positioned to benefit from continued AI demand, with AI sales in the quarter up 400% over the prior year. Overall, AI-related revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue in 2024 and is on pace to represent a majority of the company’s revenue within two to three years.” Overall AVGO ranks 4th on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

Advertisement Founded by a group of former OpenAI employees, Anthropic has emerged as a serious contender in the race for AI dominance. The flagship product is Claude , an AI chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT . Anthropic has sought to position itself as the safer, more stable alternative to OpenAI, and a company that risk-averse Fortune 500 companies can feel comfortable doing business with. That differentiation has only become more relevant as OpenAI continues to be mired in chaos and infighting. Anthropic has raised over $7 billion over the past year from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce and is reportedly raising a new round of funding that could value the company at as much as $40 billion, according to The Information. Business Insider has put together a list of the most important people running Anthropic right now. The list is by no means exhaustive, but it includes thought leaders and researchers who are contributing knowledge to the understanding of machine learning, as well as the business people working to build Anthropic into an AI behemoth. Advertisement Dario Amodei, Co-Founder and CEO Before leaving to start Anthropic, Amodei served as vice president of research at OpenAI where he led the development of breakthrough large language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3. His foundational research on reinforcement learning and scaling laws helped revolutionize the AI industry. Since its founding, Amodei has helped establish Anthropic as the safer, more business-friendly alternative to his former employer, OpenAI. Dario holds a Ph.D. in biophysics and computational neuroscience from Princeton University, where he was a Hertz Fellow. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Stanford University School of Medicine, focusing on applying machine learning to biomedical data. Daniela Amodei, Co-Founder and President Advertisement After her career in international development, Amodei was in charge of risk management and compliance at Stripe before serving as vice president of safety and policy at OpenAI. She's been in the trenches working to create sager, steerable, and reliable AI since the early days of this nascent industry. She, along with her brother Dario, was part of the team that left OpenAI with the goal of creating a more responsible AI company. Today, she oversees Anthropic's day-to-day operations and has been instrumental in shaping the company's defining ethos around safety and security. Jack Clark, Co-Founder and Head of Policy Clark made a name for himself as a journalist at Bloomberg, where he was quite possibly the world's first and, for a while only, neural networks reporter. Advertisement He would go on to serve as policy director at OpenAI and now leads a team at Anthropic that produces research into AI bias and persuasion and conducts critical red-teaming that pushes the boundaries of understanding around AI-related risk. He has proven himself to be one of AI's most eloquent thought leaders, and his newsletter, Import AI, has become required reading for anyone interested in tackling big questions in machine learning. Jared Kaplan, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer Related stories Kaplan, who boasts a PhD from Harvard, spent 15 years as a theoretical physicist in academia and continues to lecture on deep learning at Johns Hopkins University. While at OpenAI, he helped create GPT-3 and Codex, and his revolutionary work on AI scaling laws has been foundational for the entire AI industry. Kaplan helped pioneer Constitutional AI, an approach championed by Anthropic that aims to create AI systems that are constrained by and aligned with a set of predetermined principles. Advertisement Chris Olah, Co-Founder and Research Lead, Mechanistic Interpretability Olah is a researcher in the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is essentially the science of translating neural networks into algorithms that are useful to humans. Olah's research focuses on mapping out the artificial "neurons" that are part of AI models. His team achieved a significant milestone earlier this year by successfully identifying distinct neuron clusters within Anthropic's most advanced models that are associated with specific concepts and tasks, such as detecting bias or identifying fraudulent emails. By selectively activating or deactivating these neuron groups, the team demonstrated the ability to modulate the model's behavior. Advertisement Sam McCandlish, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer McCandlish oversees Anthropic's Large Language Model (LLM) Organization, which encompasses the Training, Inference, and Core Resources divisions. He also serves as the company's Responsible Scaling Officer, helping design and implement Anthropic's responsible scaling policy . McCandlish was a former research lead at OpenAI, where he spearheaded AI Safety initiatives and pioneered scaling laws that influenced technological breakthroughs like GPT-3. He holds a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Stanford University, specializing in quantum gravity and tensor networks, and an MS in Physics from Brandeis University, where he explored active matter to quantum field theory. Tom Brown, Co-Founder and Head of Core Resources Advertisement Brown was part of the technical staff at OpenAI and Google DeepMind, and, like Anthropic's other founders, his research, particularly his work on how computational power influences model performance, has helped lay the groundwork for the entire AI industry. At Anthropic, Brown is focused on the compute side of LLM development, overseeing the company's use of scarce, valuable GPUs and leading its strategic partnerships with cloud and chip providers. Brown is also an alum of the legendary tech incubator Y Combinator. Krishna Rao, Chief Financial Officer As any emerging AI company can attest, conducting groundbreaking research isn't enough. Anthropic, like most of its competitors, is also tackling the challenge of building a viable, profitable global business. Rao, who was hired in May as the company's first CFO, is helping to formulate Anthropic's financial strategy during a period of explosive growth. Advertisement He cut his teeth working at private equity giant Blackstone and management consultant Bain & Company before becoming head of business development at Airbnb. In that role, he helped the company raise billions in private capital and steered the company through its high-profile IPO. Mike Krieger, Chief Product Officer A native of São Paulo, Krieger joined Anthropic as Chief Product Officer in May 2024. He currently leads the global product team, collaborating closely with customers across industries to shape the product vision and strategy for Anthropic's flagship model, Claude. In this role, he's building deep relationships with users and helping to turn Anthropic's research into a mass-market product. Advertisement He is a cofounder of Instagram and served as its CTO, where he grew the engineering organization to more than 450 employees across the company's offices in Menlo Park, San Francisco, and New York. Brian Israel, General Counsel As generative AI opens up new avenues for technological innovation, it's also raising fraught questions about authenticity, creativity, and some of the core assumptions of our legal system. Like many of its competitors, Anthropic is deeply enmeshed in these questions, whether that's helping to guide the creation of new legal frameworks or facing lawsuits that could determine to future of the nascent AI industry. Israel is the point person helping Anthropic navigate this legal landscape. Before joining Anthropic, Brian spent nearly a decade in the US government, from the State Department to NASA, working to address the legal challenges created by emerging technologies. Advertisement Sam Bowman, Alignment Bowman co-leads Anthropic's alignment team along with Jan Leike, a safety researcher who recently left OpenAI. The team is responsible for confronting some of the thorniest questions associated with the development of advanced AI models. It works on forecasting when AI models will develop potentially dangerous abilities like deception or scheming and how humans will be able to tell when they do. The alignment team is also developing evaluations that can flag when a model reaches a concerning level of skill and reliable techniques for controlling them when they get out of line. These capabilities are essential to Anthropic's positioning of itself as the safer AI company.

Baby ] Oscar Wilde once described a cynic as a man who knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. Nowhere is understanding value more important than in the stock market. Sure, prices get quoted every second, every tick, but value, that’s a much more challenging problem. Whether you’re buying broad indices or purchasing specific stocks it pays to not be a cynic and understand both price and value of your investments. I’m Barry Ritholtz, and on today’s edition of at the money, we’re going to explain how to become more savvy about understanding equity values. The value you pay for your investment has an outsized impact on your long term returns. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your portfolio, let’s bring in Professor Aswath Damodaran of NYU School of Business. He is often referred to as the Dean of Valuation for his extensive work in the area. He’s written numerous books on the subject, including Damodaran on Valuation, Narrative and Numbers, and the textbook Investment Valuation Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset. Aswath Damodaran : So Professor, let’s just start with the basic question. Why are valuations so important when it comes to equities? I’m going to give you a cynical answer. They’re not important if you’re a trader. Traders live on pricing. I mean, the essence of pricing is you buy at a low price, you sell at a high price, and it doesn’t really matter why the price changes if you get the direction right. Value matters if you’re an investor. To me, the definition of an investor is you buy something for less than what it’s worth. And the essence of values, you’re trying to estimate what something is worth. As I said, it depends on the philosophy you bring in. Are you an investor or you’re a trader? Because that’s going to drive whether value matters to you. Barry Ritholtz : So let’s talk about identifying that intrinsic value of what something is worth. With any specific company. How can you determine? Aswath Damodaran : It’s as old as time that Venetian glassmaker who sold his business in the Middle Ages probably sold it to somebody, bought it because of the cash flows he generated, the risk in those cash flows and how much those cash flows are going to grow. It’s cash flows, growth and risk. That’s the essence of value. That’s always been true. We act like we invented valuation in the last century in finance because we came up with all these neat little models and metrics to measure risk and bring it into what you need to make. But value has always been driven by cash flows, growth and risk and how you get to that value, I use intrinsic valuation, , in that sense as capturing anybody who thinks about those fundamentals. Barry Ritholtz : Let’s dive into that intrinsic valuation based on cash flow, growth and risk. What different ways are there to measure the fundamental value of a company? And, and how do these different valuations reveal intrinsic value? Aswath Damodaran : I mean ultimately cash flows, growth and risk are not going to be different for different people. The way we think about risk though can differ depending on who you are as an investor and what do you think matters? Ii’ll give you an example in traditional finance. We think about risk by looking at how Prices move for a stock relative to the market. But there are intrinsic value people argue the true measure of risk is what happens to your earnings, your revenues, your operating metrics. So even within people who believe in intrinsic value, we can have disagreements about how to measure risk. What is the right cash flow to look at? And what’s a growth rate that you think about over what period? So while we might have 20 people in a room, all of whom buy into intrinsic value, we can come up with 20 different estimates of intrinsic value for the same company at the same point in time. Barry Ritholtz : So we always hear about price to sales, price to book, price to earnings. Are these all that different? They’re just variations on fundamentals. Or are they very different ways of looking at the same company? Aswath Damodaran : Philosophically, they’re very different because when you compute the price earnings or the EV EBITDA price to book for a company, what you do is you compare to other companies out there and you make a judgment and saying, Hey, this company trades at 10 times earnings. Other companies like it – and I’m gonna put quotes on like it – trade 15 times earnings. Therefore, it’s cheap. That’s a pricing judgment. There’s nothing value in here. There’s no intrinsic value judgment. That’s why all of sell side equity research, I would argue is all about pricing. It’s not about valuation. Nothing wrong with it, but we should be honest about what we’re doing. So when you use ratios it’s because you want to find something cheap by comparing it to other things out there that are being traded right now and you’re looking at what other people are paying. Barry Ritholtz : So you’re looking at price. When people look at stocks that way, they’re looking at price and relative valuation, not intrinsic value. [Exactly] Let’s talk about some of the things you’ve explained in your, your books. Valuation requires a deeper understanding of the business, including how it makes money and its future prospects. Give us a little more detail on that. Aswath Damodaran : I’ll give you an example. It’s a personal example. You know, I, I bought Nvidia. Yeah. purely by luck in 2018. I didn’t see AI coming, none of this stuff. So sometimes your best investments happen by accident. So last year I had to revalue NVIDIA for a simple reason. I mean, I bought it at $27 per share. The stock was trading at $800 per share and I had to decide, is it time to leave? So as I sat down to value NVIDIA, I started with the presumption that it was a computer chip company that had made chips and sold them. And I had to estimate cash flows based on that. It’s only as I started digging a little deeper that I realized that they’re not a chip maker, they’re a chip designer. Every NVIDIA chip is made by TSMC – which basically changes the way you think about the business. If you’re doing pricing, you might be able to gloss over it. It doesn’t matter that they do it. But if you’re doing intrinsic valuation, because I have to estimate cash flows, I have to think about what is it that they spend to create these revenues. And that requires an understanding of how they conduct their business. I mean, Warren Buffett, a famous saying that he doesn’t buy stocks, he buys shares of businesses. That to me, in essence, is what you’re doing in intrinsic valuation. You’re not buying a share of Apple or a share of Amazon. You’re buying a slice of those businesses . And if that’s what you’re doing, you better understand what you’re buying before you pay a price. Barry Ritholtz : So can we apply the same theory of valuation to broad indices as opposed to just individual stocks? Aswath Damodaran : Absolutely. I mean, it’s cash flows, growth and risk drive the value of Nvidia; Cash flows, growth and risk is what drives the value of the S&P500 or the NASDAQ. In fact, that’s a process I use at the start of every month to come up with an estimate of what investors are pricing in the S&P500 and what they can expect to earn given the cash flow. It’s a very intrinsic value view of what can you expect to make as a rate of return on an index. Barry Ritholtz : So that raises the real important question: What do these measures of evaluations mean for future expected returns? Aswath Damodaran : The more you pay for something, let’s cut away from all of the noise in this process. The more you pay for something up front, the lower your expected returns are going to be. (that’s just common sense). So when you buy the S&P 500 at 5,300, you can expect to earn a lower return than if you bought it at 5,100. So if you bought it last week, your expected return was lower than if you bought it today. And that’s at the basis of intrinsic value. It’s about paying the right price for something up front is the most critical decision you make. Barry Ritholtz : You, you consistently in all your books emphasize that value is not price. So how should investors think about the difference between the quoted fluctuated price we see every day, the quoted fluctuating price that we see every moment on the market and that deep intrinsic value? Aswath Damodaran : Recognize there are two different processes. Nothing makes one better than the other. Different processes. Values driven by changes in your earnings, cash flows, growth, and risk. And that’s captured by changing value over time. I’m not saying intrinsic value is somehow a stable stagnant number. The intrinsic value of NVIDIA doubled because of its entry into AI. Intrinsic value can change. Price is driven by demand and supply; driven by mood and momentum. And I think one of the best indicators you can take a mood and momentum is when the momentum is good, all news is good news. In fact, there’s a whole segment of finance called behavioral finance. And behavioral finance tries to explain why price can not only deviate from value, but stay different for long periods. There’s this inherent belief that value investors have that price will move towards value and it’ll happen quickly. That’s not true. Price can deviate from value. It can stay separated from value for long periods, which means if you’re an intrinsic value investor, you’re going to get incredibly frustrated because you think you got it right, but you keep losing money. Barry Ritholtz : So you’re referring to mean reversion. The expectation is that pricey things eventually come back down to fair value and inexpensive things will eventually be recognized and return to fair value. How long does this process take? Is it guaranteed to happen? Does that mean reversion always occur? Aswath Damodaran : It’s not just mean reversion – it’s an assumption that values what matters in the long term. When I start my valuation class, I started the question. Do you have faith? My students look at me and say, it’s a valuation class. What are you talking about? I said, the essence of investing is faith, faith that your estimated value is the right value and faith that the price will move to value. And the essence of faith is, if you ask me to prove it, and if you told me, “Tell me what will cause it to happen,” my answer is, I don’t know, it’s a mystery. I mean, it’s like going to church and going up to your pastor or your rabbi and saying, can you give me some proof that God exists? I keep coming back every, you know, every week because I, and if that rabbi or priest or, you know, is telling you the truth, they should say, look, you know, I can’t give you that proof, it’s faith. And I think that’s what makes investing so difficult is it’s driven by faith rather than by proof. So if you ask me, you know, if I bought something undervalued, am I guaranteed to make money in the long term? Absolutely not. And you have to be okay with it. If you’re not okay with it, buy an index fund. Or be a trader. The essence of investing is you can do everything right. And I have nothing to show for it, and you have to be okay with that. Barry Ritholtz : Wow. So, Professor, bottom line it for us, when we think about valuation, when investors look at equities, what should be foremost in their mind before deploying capital? Aswath Damodaran : First, be honest with yourself. Now, what is the game you’re playing? If you’re playing the trading game, don’t lie to yourself about caring about fundamentals and earnings and cash flows. Just play the trading game. Look at charts, look at technical indicators, look at mood and momentum, because that’s what you’re playing. If you want to be an investor, you need to do your homework. You can’t hide behind the fact of “I’ve never done an accounting or evaluation class. I don’t understand these financial statements.” The essence of investing is you got to be able to look through those financial statements and be able to gauge the value of a company. You might not want to use the full technology of intrinsic valuation, but you need to start thinking about businesses and value in a much more, in a much deeper way than you’re doing right now. If that’s not your thing, that’s fine. There are lots of people who get rich as traders and there’s nothing wrong with trading. Just play that game well. Barry Ritholtz : So, to wrap up, investors who have a long-term time horizon should be very aware of the variations in valuations. The more you pay for a given stock or a given market index, the lower your future expected returns are. Understand that there are no guarantees in the market, and merely buying cheap stocks is no guarantee that you’re going to outperform or even market perform in the future.

What US Interest-Rate Cuts Mean for China by Andrew Sheng & Xiao Geng - Project Syndicate Skip to main content Si Wei/Xinhua via ZUMA Wire en English de German ru Russian Economics 0 What US Interest-Rate Cuts Mean for China Oct 9, 2024 Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng For China, the US Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts create an opportunity to address deflation and revive domestic market confidence, thereby buying more time for structural reform. Fortunately, this is not lost on China’s leaders, who have introduced an ambitious economic stimulus package. HONG KONG – Last month, the US Federal Reserve initiated its first monetary-easing cycle in more than four years. With a 50-basis-point cut, the Fed brought the federal funds rate down from its 20-year high of 5.3% to a range of 4.75-5%. This is good news for China, which now has much more room to maneuver in its quest to reflate its economy. https://prosyn.org/gpYuqaV To continue reading, register now. It’s free!

Don Butler is a Managing Director with Thomvest Ventures. Don manages the Firm's investments in the areas of financial and marketing technologies. Following Oct 9, 2024, 01:13pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin I was at a venture investor dinner last month where our host asked each of us to stand up and, as part of our self-introductions, to state where we needed help from the group and where we could help others. One of my fellow investors, a partner at a well-known firm, joked that he was “looking for this thing called liquidity” and asked if anyone knew where to find it. The wave of laughter from the crowd spoke volumes. This also caused me to reflect on the things we’ve learned about liquidity over the last few years. Fortunately, it appears that the decline in interest rates means that many of us will begin to find liquidity in 2025 and beyond. Lessons from the interest rate hikes As part of a broader family office, we have seen firsthand how the interest rate increases affected the work of our asset allocation team. The rise in interest rates changed the investment landscape and gave rise to a long-missed category for asset allocators: the ability to put money to work in credit and to earn meaningful rates of return. To make matters worse for those of us investing in venture, the interest rate increases also impacted venture outcomes negatively by increasing the cost of borrowing for acquisitions by private equity firms. This has helped throttle the M&A market, which is the primary source by dollar value of exits in the venture ecosystem. This combination of factors, along with the lingering hangovers from a frothy IPO market, has helped curtail exits and thus distributions to limited partners in funds. They have thus cut back on re-investing into new funds over the last two years. In fact, it’s created a set of circumstances that we haven’t seen in roughly twenty years: a time in which venture exits were few and far between and yet the rates of return in shorter-duration, relatively risk-free, liquid assets became meaningful. How correlated are interest rates to venture outcomes? To understand the degree to which interest rates and exits in the venture ecosystem are correlated, we looked at the correlation over the last twenty years between (a) 10-Year U.S. Treasury average annual yields, (b), the total deal volume in dollars for mergers and acquisitions of U.S. venture-backed companies, and (c) the deal volume in dollars of IPOs of U.S. venture-backed companies. We looked at 10-Year Treasury yields from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ FRED dataset and exit volumes for U.S.-based venture-backed companies from Pitchbook. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yields vs. U.S. VC-Backed Company Exit Volumes Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED); Pitchbook, Inc. Data for 2024 exit volumes annualized to give a full-year estimate. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor To quantify the degree of correlation between 10-Year Treasury annual yields and M&A and IPO values, we inflation-adjusted earlier year exit values to normalize these amounts for our analysis. We found that the 10-Year Treasury rate had a correlation coefficient of -0.577 versus U.S. Tech IPOs, indicating a moderately negative correlation (with an R-squared value of 0.333, implying that as much as a third of the variance in the latter could potentially be explained via movements in the interest rate). We found that the 10-Year Treasury annual yield had a correlation coefficient of -0.670 with U.S. M&A values, indicating a strong negative correlation (with an R-squared value of 0.433). The implications are that higher interest rates generally are associated with periods of lower exit volumes, as has become abundantly clear in the search for liquidity among venture investors over the last two years. There are obviously a host of factors that lead to liquidity (or the lack thereof) in a given market, but it’s also interesting to see the extent to which something as macro as the interest rate regime appears to be one of them. The outlook going forward We believe that the recent shift to declining interest rates is a harbinger of better times ahead when it comes to exits. Though the analysis above only speaks to correlation and not causation, we see other signs that point to an opening IPO window as well as clear, anecdotal evidence that private equity and corporate M&A is already starting to pick back up. For those companies that have been able to survive and thrive over the last few years, we think we’ll see many more opportunities to exit and that this, in turn, will pave the way towards reinvestments into the venture ecosystem. The dry patch that we’ve experienced should soon be over if the last twenty years is a guide to what we might expect going forward. Follow me on LinkedIn . Check out my website .

Advertisement BlackRock became the world's largest asset manager because it made cheap funds for the masses. Now, the $11.5 trillion behemoth wants to put high-fee private market strategies in your portfolio. The firm brought in more assets last quarter — $221 billion — than ever before, but on its earnings call, the firm's leaders focused more on integrating strategies from the recent acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners into model portfolios than on its ballooning ETF franchise. "This is a revenue growth story," said BlackRock's chief financial officer Martin Small Friday morning. GIP, the infrastructure asset manager that BlackRock paid $12.5 billion for, is expected to add $250 million in management fees to BlackRock's bottom line in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a meaningful accelerant to our private markets capabilities," he said. Advertisement A quarter century after BlackRock went public — the firm IPOed on October 1, 1999 — the firm hopes to blend its private market strategies into its model portfolios for wealth managers. Private equity and private credit strategies have the potential to bring on higher returns but are also less liquid and more expensive investments than mutual funds or ETFs. The manager is hoping to be the builder of next-generation technology, whether that's data centers needed for artificial intelligence or infrastructure needed for decarbonization. "We're not going to say they're alternatives because they'll just be part of the market," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, about private strategies, which have long been touted in industry lingo as "alternatives" to the public market. Related stories Fink said risk will be measured by the liquidity of these blended portfolios. The firm's $3.2 billion acquisition of data giant Preqin will help bring these more complex strategies to a broader audience. The acquisition is set to close at the end of the year. "It's going to happen with the expansion of data and analytics," Fink said. Advertisement The firm's focus may be shifting because there aren't many more levers to pull for increased growth in its iShares franchise, which crossed $1 trillion in total assets last quarter. The firm's leaders said the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong one for this segment of their business, and the franchise has also seen serious inflows following political events and central bank decisions. Comparatively, retail allocation to the private markets is in the "low-single digits," according to Small, giving BlackRock another territory to expand into. "The opportunities ahead of us have never been better than they are now," Fink said. Private credit, for example, could pick up billions of dollars from the firm's insurance clients, which have $700 billion invested with BlackRock. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," Fink said, and private market strategies are the latest roll of the dice.

Log in Subscribe This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . The moment I saw I had an email from my solar company, I knew my nightmare was about to take another unsettling turn. For weeks, I'd been wrangling with my solar dealer about the panels it had installed on my roof months earlier. I'd passed all the necessary inspections. Someone just needed to flip a switch and turn them on, and my family would finally start saving about $400 a month in electricity during the blistering summers here in Fresno, California. But Sun Solar, the redundantly named dealer, kept giving me the runaround. I nagged them so much that I eventually got a call from a supervisor who told me the company couldn't turn the panels on until it had approval from its partner, SunPower. And that email from SunPower finally confirmed my suspicions: The company, one of the biggest solar providers in the country, announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection. Advertisement I was furious. I frantically called back Sun Solar, demanding answers. The sales rep was empathetic and candid. He, too, had a lot of questions for SunPower — what did its going under mean for his business? But he didn't know any more than I did about how much longer my solar panels would remain useless. I hung up, dejected. Then I went through a tailspin of self-doubt. Why had I become a homeowner in the first place? Our apartment in New York City was tiny, but if anything happened, all I had to do was call my super. Also, how could I have missed that this company was in trouble? I'm a business journalist, after all, and I thought I'd done my research on SunPower. It was one of the oldest and most respected companies in residential solar still in operation. But after digging a bit further, I quickly learned that SunPower was far from alone. At a time when solar is most needed to stave off the climate crisis , much of the industry is cooling. Over the past few years, high interest rates have decimated demand for residential solar, resulting in layoffs (more than 17,000 in 2023 among California solar companies alone), questionable financial engineering that's been compared to the subprime-lending crisis that sparked the Great Recession, and many, many bankruptcies — more than 100 across America so far this year. Meanwhile, my solar panels have been sitting on my roof for four months, entirely unused, taunting me from above. Over another summer of record-breaking heat, my electricity bills were astronomical. As it's only getting hotter, the solar industry threatens to leave us in the dark. California's Central Valley is prime solar-power country. There's rarely a rainy day here and ample sunlight for solar panels to take in and convert to electricity. It's rare to see a house here without solar panels. But there are a few, and mine was one of them. Solar companies knew that. Advertisement Earlier this year, I'd get calls every day from solar companies eager to pitch me on getting a system installed on my house. Sales reps from companies like Sunrun would also frequently knock on my door, asking whether I would consider solar. It happened so much that my wife and I decided to post a "no soliciting" sign out front. But in the end, all that nagging worked — I was sold on the potential for savings. Getting electricity from my provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, one of the three main providers in the state, is staggeringly expensive. Since 2020, PG&E's residential-electricity rates have risen 38% after you adjust for inflation, Severin Borenstein, a professor at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, wrote in a blog post. In the past 15 months alone, PG&E has hiked its rates four times. During previous summers, when daily highs averaged over 100 degrees for weeks on end, several of my neighbors' monthly electricity bills reached nearly $1,000 — close to the average monthly rent in Fresno. I did not want that. Related stories Neither do many homeowners across America. From 2015 to 2022, residential solar installations climbed by an average of 15% a year. Some can afford to buy an entire solar system, which costs about $12,500 on average, or finance it with a loan. Often, though, homeowners enter into arrangements like power purchase agreements, in which there are no up-front costs. The company goes out and finds capital to fund the project, installs the system, and then charges a monthly rate over a 20- or 25-year lease. Over the past five years, nearly one-quarter of homeowners in California who have had solar panels installed have gone with that agreement — including me. After I called Sun Solar in March, the SunPower dealer, my solar project was in motion within a week. But as my project progressed, I missed several signs that SunPower, along with much of the solar industry, was in a downward spiral. The company lost $200 million in 2023, and 2024 was shaping up to be worse. In the months since I called Sun Solar, had my panels installed, and waited, and waited, for an update, SunPower received notice from Nasdaq that it was out of compliance for not filing forms on time, its accounting firm, Ernst & Young, resigned, and its stock cratered to less than $0.70 a share. Advertisement Gordon Johnson, the founder and CEO of the equity-research firm GLJ Research, said the solar-panel systems offered by companies like SunPower and its main rivals, Sunnova and Sunrun, rarely make any money for the companies. "Solar is extremely uneconomical," he said. Part of what makes solar attractive is the 30% federal tax credit. Homeowners are eligible for it if they buy the panels themselves. If they opt for a power purchase agreement, the solar company can claim a similar credit — a practice that has recently come under scrutiny. Johnson said many solar companies use questionable accounting practices to inflate the value of solar systems and get larger government tax credits, which they then go shop on the open market and sell to companies such as Alphabet and Meta. "This industry is rife with fraud," Johnson said. Stock analysts aren't the only ones calling the residential-solar model into question. Late last year, Forbes said an industry whistleblower had reported to the IRS that bloated tax-credit claims were widespread across the residential-solar space. In August, the Stanford professor David F. Larcker and Brian Tayan, a corporate-governance researcher at the school, published an alarming analysis titled "Solar Flare Up: Systemic Organizational Risk in the Residential Solar Industry." The authors said a cocktail of convoluted financing, tax credits, high sales commissions, and uncertain costs "have combined to create an incredibly complex industry with multiple points of potential breakdown." They cited the recent bankruptcies of the solar giants Titan Solar, iSun, SunPower, and various others "due to financial distress, changes in regulatory standards, or fraud" as harbingers for a wider collapse. The insurer Solar Insure says nearly 75% of solar installers in California are at a "high risk" of shutting down. Advertisement Some, however, remain optimistic about residential solar's long-term prospects. "The fact that SunPower went bankrupt was largely self-inflicted," Pavel Molchanov, a managing director at Raymond James, said. "There are plenty of other companies who do rooftop solar in this country that are alive and well." He pointed out that the cost of electricity from utility providers is only going to go up — the national average cost increased 11% in 2022 and 6% in 2023 — and the cost of solar equipment has become cheaper, making solar electricity an attractive option for consumers. There's also still a huge market since 95% of single-family US homes don't have solar. But among the 5% of us who do, many of us remain in purgatory, awaiting our troubled corporate sun gods to decide our fate. Related stories A few days after my deflating call with the Sun Solar sales rep, I heard from the company's vice president of sales. While he was empathetic, he made clear that there wasn't much I could do: SunPower had communicated to the company that it couldn't touch the panels on my roof, which meant I was stuck with a lifeless solar system and couldn't seek out alternatives. A couple of days later, he called me back with a couple of options: I could buy the system outright in cash, for just over $54,000 — $38,000 with the tax credit — or finance it. In response to a detailed list of questions I asked for this story, SunPower directed me to the same press release announcing it was filing for bankruptcy protection that it had sent me as a customer, adding that it would provide updates when they became available. The dealer, Sun Solar, did not respond to these questions, either. Advertisement I also reached out to California's Contractors State License Board, which regulates solar companies, asking what recourse SunPower's customers had. In an emailed statement, it said the board had "identified substantial violations or concerns related to SunPower's operations" and "initiated formal disciplinary proceedings" to revoke the company's contractor license. It added that it had received complaints about SunPower . It has forwarded the case to the state's attorney general's office. For customers, the board recommends they consult with an attorney. I still haven't decided what I'll do. But it seems ludicrous to buy a solar system that I had no intention of buying in the first place. And with the state of residential solar in limbo, it's an option I have serious doubts about. I'm reminded of this ordeal every day I return to my house and see the gleaming, useless solar panel ornaments adorning my roof. It feels like I'm trapped in a dark comedy sitcom depicting life as a millennial homeowner. Then, like a bad punchline, I pull into the garage and turn on the lights.

Following Oct 10, 2024, 11:36am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Deal Overview On September 20, 2024, Lennar Corporation (NASDAQ: LEN, $180.45; Market Capitalization: $48.6 billion), one of the largest homebuilders in the US, announced its intention to spin off some of its land banking assets. The spin-off, named Millrose Properties Inc. (Millrose), is anticipated to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), which will acquire and develop land for Lennar and other home builders, providing fully developed homesites through land option contracts. Post transaction completion, Millrose (SpinCo) is expected to have an asset base of $6.0-$8.0 billion with no debt. The new entity will focus on acquiring, developing, and managing land for residential and commercial purposes. It will also provide land options to Lennar and other homebuilders. Under this arrangement, Lennar will have option purchase agreements to purchase back finished homesites on a just-in-time basis. Meanwhile, Lennar (RemainCo) will focus on being a pure-play homebuilder specializing in the construction and sale of homes, primarily focusing on entry-level and first-time buyers, supported with an asset-light, land-light strategy. Lennar Price Performance Spin-Off Details Top 5 Shareholders Spin-Off Research Lennar is expected to contribute all its undeveloped, partially developed, and some fully developed land and cash to Millrose in exchange for its stock. This will then be distributed as a stock dividend to Lennar shareholders. As these contributions will be debt-free, Millrose will operate as an independent REIT with no equity ties to Lennar. The spin-off underscores Lennar’s shift toward an asset-light, land-light business model, a direction the home builder has been moving since 2020. Previously, on March 17, 2021, Lennar had announced its plans to consider spinning off some of its ancillary business divisions to become a focused, pure-play homebuilding and allied financial services company. Later, on July 29, 2022, the spin-off was named Quarterra Multifamily (QMF), which focused on developing, owning, and managing the multifamily, single family rental, and land development strategies on behalf of institutional partners. However, due to unfavorable market conditions, the spin-off was postponed. Additional details about Millrose Properties, including its REIT structure and timeline for the spin-off completion, are unavailable. The transaction is still going through a confidential review process with the SEC, so additional disclosures will be available once the S-11 SEC registration statement is made public. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Key Data Spin-Off Research Deal Rationale Lennar Corporation is among the leading builders of quality homes for all generations. Its operating segments include Homebuilding operations, Financial Services, Multifamily, and Lennar Other. The company’s management intends to transform it into a pure-play, asset-light homebuilder. This vision includes the development of a “just-in-time” homesite delivery program, where land is held and developed by third-party entities until Lennar is ready to build. This approach reflects a culmination of nearly a decade-long strategic pivot towards a more streamlined, homebuilder-centric model. It aims to enhance cash flow, reduce capital expenditure, and improve returns on invested equity. For the last several years, the company has been reducing its reliance on land it owns and increasing its access to land through options and joint ventures. As of September 30, 2024, 81.0% of its total homesites were controlled through options with land banks, land sellers and joint ventures, compared to 73.0% as of September 30, 2023. Management believes that operating as a pure-play homebuilder and financial services company could simplify its structure and enhance value for its shareholders. The company is currently looking at approximately a $6.0 billion to $8.0 billion of land that it expects to spin-off into a new public company with no associated debt. The spin-off highlights Lennar’s transition to a business model with reduced exposure to the high carrying costs related to land assets. This protects the company from potential market downturns that could devalue these holdings. As per management, the spin-off would be a way to have a consistent source of funding as the company moves to a “land light” construction model. It is also expected to help Lennar shift from relying on private equity to fund the land acquisition and development operations. This move underscores a broader trend towards the ”asset-light” business model, which is now widely being adopted by major homebuilding enterprises, public and private. The proposed spin-off could also drive a re-rating for Lennar (RemainCo) over time, as the market assesses the company’s new profile when the spin is completed. By reducing the opacity associated with land speculation and focusing on core homebuilding operations, Lennar aims to create a more transparent and predictable business model. This transparency is expected to unlock new shareholder value as investors gain clearer insights into the company’s operational efficiency and financial health. In the rapidly evolving, volatile, and unpredictable US residential construction and real estate development market, Lennar’s announcement to spin off a substantial portion of its land holdings marks a significant strategic shift. These steps are expected to streamline Lennar’s operations, improve cash flow, and reduce financial risk, positioning the company for sustained growth. On the other hand, the transaction should enable Millrose to raise third-party capital to support its ongoing land development operations. The company will generate returns primarily through option fees rather than relying on land appreciation, adding stability to its income streams and plans to reinvest proceeds from land transactions into new land and development projects, maintaining a continuous investment cycle without the need to return capital to investors. Lennar Corporation is one of the largest homebuilders in the US. The company originates residential and commercial mortgage loans, provides title insurance and closing services, and develops multifamily rental properties. Additionally, it sponsors and manages funds and joint ventures focused on developing and owning multifamily rental properties and a fund dedicated to single-family rental properties. Lennar is also invested in companies that leverage technology to enhance the homebuilding industry and various aspects of real estate-related financial services. Homebuilding Lennar’s homebuilding operations are spread wide across the real-estate space, including the purchase, development, and sale of residential land and the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes. The company’s target customer base includes first-time, move-up, active adult, and luxury homebuyers. The offerings are spread across many locations, ranging from suburban golf course communities to urban infill communities. The company leverages its “Everything’s Included” marketing program to include luxury items as part of its standard model offerings at competitive prices to differentiate from competitors. Further, the company has built-in wireless capability, home automation and solar power facilities to improve its brand value and ability to generate traffic and subsequent sales. The company leverages its flexible operating structure to make decisions based on localized homebuilding conditions and customer tastes and preferences with oversight from a centralized management structure. The company generally acquired or obtained options to acquire land for developing and constructing homes that it sells to homebuyers. However, it is now accelerating its land light strategy by reducing its supply of homesites and expanding the portion of land controlled through joint ventures and options. As of September 30, 2024, 81.0% of its total homesites were controlled through options with land banks, land sellers and joint ventures, compared to 73.0% as of September 30, 2023. Financial Services Lennar’s Financial Services operations are bifurcated through functionality in Residential Mortgage Financing, Title, Insurance & Closing Services and Commercial Mortgage Origination. Under Residential Mortgage Financing, the company offers conforming conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loan products and other home mortgage products. The company provides these offerings through its financial services subsidiary, Lennar Mortgage, in a majority of the states where the company has its homebuilding operations. The company sells off substantially all residential mortgage loans that it originates in the secondary mortgage market, generally on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. Lennar is also licensed to provide title insurance and closing services for residential and commercial transactions across 41 states to its homebuyers and others. Lennar’s LMF Commercial subsidiary originates and sells into securitizations’ first mortgage loans that are secured by income-generating commercial properties. The loans generally are between $5.0 million to $50.0 million each. LMF Commercial also originates floating rate loans secured by commercial real estate properties. The company has been increasingly incorporating technology to automate processes within its mortgage loan origination, allowing it to increase the number of digital closings, featuring digital document signing and digital notarization. Multifamily Operations Lennar’s Multifamily business manages and holds interests in long-term funds that develop multifamily communities, aiming to retain them as rental income-generating assets. These communities feature a diverse mix of conventional garden, mid-rise, and high-rise properties in urban and suburban areas near major employment centres. Most offer a variety of studio, one, two, and three-bedroom homes. As of September 30, 2024, the Multifamily business managed funds and ventures with a pipeline of 52 potential future developments, either owned, under contract or subject to letters of intent, with anticipated development costs totaling approximately $6.8 billion across several states. Lennar Other This segment comprises of investments by Lennar in companies involved in technology initiatives that help it enhance the homebuying experience and reduce SG&A expenses. These Strategic technology investments include Blend Labs (digital lending platform developer for fast-tracking the consumer finance process), Doma Holdings (predictive analytics platform for title insurers), and Opendoor (enables streamlining of home buying and selling process), among others. Revenue Trend and EBIT vs. Margin Trend Spin-Off Research 3Q24 results Total revenue increased 7.9% YoY to $9.4 billion (+2.3% vs. consensus), led by 8.7% YoY growth in the Homebuilding segment to $9.0 billion and a 2.7% YoY growth in the Financial services segment to $273.3 million. Multifamily segment revenue declined 32.0% YoY to $93.4 million due to a decrease in general contractor and management fee income. Lennar Other segment revenue declined 50.8% YoY to $3.6 million. EBIT grew 1.5% YoY to $1.6 billion (+14.1% vs. consensus), while the corresponding margin contracted ~104 bps to 16.5%, impacted by a decline in the operating earnings of the homebuilding segment due to a decline in the average sale prices during the quarter. Net earnings attributable to shareholders grew 4.8% YoY to $1.2 billion (+17.0% vs. consensus), while the corresponding margin contracted ~36 bps to 12.3%. Basic and Diluted earnings per share stood at $4.26 (3Q23: $3.87), beating the consensus by 16.6%. For the Homebuilding segment, the 15.9% YoY rise in home deliveries fueled the 8.7% rise in revenue to $9.0 billion, partly impacted by a 5.8% decline in average sales price. Gross margin contracted by ~190bps YoY to 22.5% (3Q23: 24.4%), due to a drop in revenue per square foot and rising land costs, partially balanced by lower material costs due to reduced construction expenses. Operating earnings declined by 1.1% to $1.5 billion. For the Financial Services segment, operating earnings declined by 2.7% YoY to $144.0 million (3Q23: $148.0 million), primarily due to lower lock volume and margin in the mortgage business, partially offset by higher volume in the title business because of increased deliveries YoY. 3Q24 Results Spin-Off Research FY23 results Total revenue increased 1.7% YOY to $34.2 billion (+2.1% vs. consensus), led by 2.2% YoY growth in the Homebuilding segment to $32.7 billion, supported by 20.6% YoY growth in the Financial Services segment to $976.9 million. Multifamily segment revenue declined 33.7% YoY to $573.5 million, and Lennar Other segment revenue declined 50.4% YoY to $22.0 million. EBIT declined 13.6% YoY to $5.4 billion (+2.0% vs consensus), and the corresponding margin contracted ~281 bps to 15.9%, impacted by a decline in the operating earnings of the homebuilding segment by 18.1% YoY due to a decrease in the average sale prices during the year. Net earnings attributable to shareholders declined 14.6% YoY to $3.9 billion (+1.7% vs. consensus), and the corresponding margin contracted ~220 bps to 11.5%. Diluted earnings per share stood at $13.73 (FY22: $15.72), beating the consensus by 1.3%. For the Homebuilding segment, the 10.1% YoY rise in home deliveries fueled the 2.2% rise in revenue to $32.7 billion, negatively impacted by a 7.1% decline in average sales price. Gross margin contracted by ~420bps YoY to 23.3% (FY22: 27.5%), because of a decrease in average sales price, which was partially offset by a decrease in costs per square foot due to a reduction in construction cost expenses. Operating earnings declined by 18.4% to $5

US PE firm Kaho Partners targets M&A in international cuisine Credit: Suzanne Pratt / Shutterstock After selling US pie maker Kenny’s Great Pies earlier this year, private-equity firm Kaho Partners is embarking on its next move on food. Managing partner Griffin Horter is leading Global Flavors Group, a newly-established “platform” to buy manufacturers of Mediterranean, Asian, Indian and Hispanic foods. Go deeper with GlobalData Reports PepsiCo Indonesia - Failure Case Study Data Insights The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more He tells Just Food Kaho Partners is in talks with potential sellers and expects to finalise its first deal within the next 12 months. Dean Best (DB): What’s sparked Kaho Partners’ interest in the market for international cuisine in the US? Griffin Horter (GH): There are two tailwinds we’re investing behind. One is increasing diversity [in the US population] but the second, which I think is actually more powerful, is the growing interest in authentic international flavours from the overall US population. Every US citizen is being exposed to more people from different backgrounds, therefore more restaurants with international cuisines are opening in the US. You go to a grocery store, there’s more international food in the grocery store. There was a great study that came out recently that interviewed a large group of Gen Z people and the question was: if you could eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be? And the answer was Mexican. The traditional answer to that question for the last 20 or 30 years had been Italian food. That used to be seen as international or ethnic but now it’s mainstream in the US. The fact that 45% of Gen Z respondents said that Mexican would be the one cuisine they would eat for the rest of their lives shows you that this is a trend for the overall population. See Also: Entangled Capital buys majority stake in Martino couscous owner Bikaji Foods to buy majority stake in The Hazelnut Factory DB: Kaho Partners said it is looking for businesses generating less than $10m of profit. Why is that? GH : We have pinned it at that level because we’re looking for small, nimble, growing companies. We’re not looking for companies that have already reached the scale where a PepsiCo might buy them as an example . Our vision here is that we’re not looking to buy one company. We’re looking to buy a handful, two handfuls of businesses over the next five to eight years so that we can have a portfolio of manufacturing assets and be the one-stop solution, one-stop shop, for these retailers to come to us for their authentic international cuisine needs.

Our services are intended for corporate subscribers and you warrant that the email address submitted is your corporate email address. DB: Is your interest evenly spread across the four cuisine types? GH : I would say it’s spread across them evenly to start with. What that means is I’m looking at companies in all of those cuisines today but, once we make the first acquisition, our focus for the platform will be on that cuisine. For instance, if the first company we buy is a Hispanic food manufacturer, then the platform is going to be focused on Hispanic food. DB: Are you in any live discussions at the moment? GH : Yes, I’m in a number of them. DB: When do you expect the first deal to be announced? GH : That is really hard to guess because most of the companies I’m in conversations with, they’re not auction processes, right? Those transactions can take a while because it’s kind of like dating. My hope is in the next six to 12 months. That’s my expectation. DB: What other attributes would interesting businesses have to have for Global Flavors Group? GH : The most important thing is they have to do their own manufacturing. We’re not looking to acquire brands that outsource their manufacturing. We’re looking to acquire companies that are great at sufficiently manufacturing authentic international cuisine. That’s number one. Number two is we want them to be focused on a small group of products. We don’t want to acquire a company that is making 600 different products. We want companies that are small, that are focused on a small handful of products, and are leaders in those products. DB: What current retail distribution would they have to have to get Kaho Partners interested in talking to them? GH: We would like to see companies that have broken into mainstream retail. International cuisine has traditionally gone to market through specialised retailers, which tend to be smaller stores. As these manufacturing companies get bigger, they can break into what’s referred to as mainstream retail, which tends to be customers like Sam’s Club, Walmart, Kroger, H-E-B. We want to acquire companies that are on that journey, who have already broken into mainstream retail but likely need help breaking into additional large national retail chains. DB: Similar to the profitability benchmark, is there a level of sales you’re looking for? GH: No, there isn’t. We’re just focused on making sure that the companies are profitable and that they’re less than $10m in profit. DB: Given the fragmentation of the category, to what extent do you think that makes it harder to choose the right acquisition? GH : I think it makes it easier for us. When we look for an industry to build a business in, fragmentation is one of the top two criteria we look for alongside growth tailwinds in an industry. We don’t want to focus on an industry that only has ten companies. Then you have to buy one of those ten. We want to look at industries that are very fragmented, so that we can look at 100 companies and find the best two or three to start with. DB: What’s your assessment of the overall M&A environment in US food at the moment? GH : I think that now is a very good time to be both buying and selling food businesses. I think what the pandemic taught buyers in the space is that one of the reasons we like food is people think that it’s recession-resilient. We saw that during Covid. Even when there are downturns in the economy, people still need to buy food. Kaho Partners managing partner Griffin Horter M&A activity was very slow from call it ‘21 to ‘23 because there was some demand destruction due to Covid and then, when demand came back, there was hyperinflation, and all the companies were dealing with cost issues. A lot of the big acquirers, both strategics and private-equity funds, took a year or two off. We’re seeing a lot of activity in the M&A markets in the food space this year. I think a good example of that is our pie company. We got a ton of interest, much more interest than I expected to get to that business and that’s because a lot of buyers really wanted to play capital behind food. DB: What level of funding do you have at your disposal for this platform? GH: We partner with family offices because we like to build businesses over five to eight years. In order to do that, you can’t raise a private-equity fund, because if you do that, you can only spend three to five years building a business. What we will do for this one is partner with some of our existing family offices, and then our partnership, Kaho Partners, will invest a lot of money into the deal as well. It’s the money that’s coming from our partnership and then from our family office relationships. DB: Are you able to give me a dollar figure? GH : No, I can’t unfortunately. DB: A lot could happen between now and then, obviously, but after that, five- to eight-year period, you’ll be looking to exit and sell on to either another PE firm or a potential interested buyer in the trade? GH : Well, there are three potential outcomes. One is we sell to a private-equity fund. To be frank, this thesis we have in international cuisine isn’t rocket science. I like to tell people that this is a simple but very powerful idea. A lot of other people see these trends. One of the reasons we like this space is the bigger private-equity funds see this trend but there aren’t many scaled players. It’s a fragmented space and there are a lot of small companies but the companies are so small that most private-equity funds can’t buy them. You have a lot of big private equity funds who want to invest in this theme but there aren’t many scaled players. We’re going to build a scaled player. I’m confident there will be a lot of interest from private equity in five to eight years. I’m also confident there will be a lot of interest from strategic acquirers in five to eight years. Those are our first two outcomes. We can settle one of those two. The third outcome is, if this is going really well and we believe in the growth story, we could keep holding the business, whether that’s through our existing investor base of family offices, which have a long-term investment horizon, or taking the company public. It’s difficult to say today. The good thing is we’ve optionality. DB: Is Kaho Partners looking to invest in any other parts of the food industry? GH : No. We’re very focused. We’re an investment partnership. We only build three or four companies at a time. This is the only company that we’re currently looking at platforms for. We’re not going to start a new business for the next probably four or five years. This is our focus in the food and beverage space.

BlackRock's assets hit record $11.5 trillion amid private market push Read full article Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia Updated Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 11:10 PM 3 min read Link Copied 4 In this article: By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working," Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. "Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth," Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but "relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. Story continues "The combination of a strong ETF franchise, an expansion into private markets, a favorable market tailwind, and contributions from acquisitions combined to widen the moat around BlackRock,” said Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA.

Following Oct 10, 2024, 12:09pm EDT Updated Oct 12, 2024, 02:09pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Morgan Stanley’s latest report pegs the BCI market at $400 billion in the US alone. “ Brain Computer Interface Primer: The Next Big MedTech Opportunity ?” by the bank’s equity analysts provides timely research, signaling to investors that this emerging frontier holds potential to generate substantial returns in future decades. This 37-page report includes a commercial history, industry landscape and deep dives into eight ... [+] major market segments for early and intermediate adoption of BCI through 2045. Morgan Stanley Research Note: As of publishing this article, Morgan Stanley’s 37-page report appears unlinked to a dedicated url, but the PDF has been circulating the commercial corridors of neurotech networks. This article is not the report. I’ll update this article with a dedicated link if I find one; If you are unable to access the file, just reach out. Major Takeaways In addition to a brief summary of BCI’s origins and commercial history, the report covers key topics related to medical device outlook and ends with some speculation about the more distant future of this technology. But in a word, it’s about the TAM. Investors and commercial leaders should understand the rationale behind the Total Attainable Market before they choose to believe it or not. The assumptions and fine print driving the analysis are the GPS for navigating BCI investment today more than any singular estimate. Here’s what you need to know: Timeline to Scale : The authors expect commercial activity (product launch + reimbursement) “in about 5 years.” Over the next decade they forecast about $1.5 billion cumulative revenue, after which revenue could reach an annual run rate of $500 million by 2036 and $1 billion by 2041. But even by 2045, their models suggest market penetration will still only be 2.8%, meaning any “hockey stick curve” won’t occur for another 20 years. Segmentation : Against their estimate of “nearly 10 million potential BCI candidates in the US,” they slice this into an a) early TAM, and b) intermediate TAM. Early TAM - $80.8 billion : At least 2.8 million patients in the US, consisting of people with “critical upper limb impairment” as well as conditions like epilepsy and depression. The authors suggest these people will be first adopters of BCI. Intermediate TAM - $320 billion : An additional 6.8 million people who have “moderate upper limb impairment and severe lower limb impairment,” will be the follow-on adopters, who opt for BCI once the technology is proven out in above applications. 8 Key Market Segments: ALS, Stroke, Spinal Cord Injury, Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Limb Amputation, Epilepsy and Depression are identified as key indications where BCI would see uptake. More detail below. Companies Mentioned: Synchron, Neuralink, Paradromics, and Precision are featured in the report, while Motif, CorTec and InBrain Neuroelectronics also get a mention. Growth Drivers: Demographic trends, shifting norms, regulatory reforms and medical acceptance through emergence of clinical outcomes assessments and practice guidelines will slowly build traction. After BCI becomes established at a 1% penetration rate about a decade from now, the growth of clinical data, favorable insurance coverage, industry traction, and other factors could accelerate adoption. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Monetizing Medical Devices An important caveat: Topline estimates only captures “potential revenue from a single implant procedure, ignoring a potential replacement cycle and likely recurring revenues from software.” Curiously, while they cross-reference their BCI estimates against other implanted neurotech markets like “spinal cord stimulation ($2bn annual run rate), sacral neuromodulation ($1bn annual run rate), and hypoglossal nerve stimulation ($800mn annual run rate),” they leave out deep brain stimulation from their comparisons. "Cost components of DBS surgery. Cost of DBS device, surgery, total cost of surgery, and total cost ... [+] of treatment." Stereotactic & Functional Neurosurgery (https://doi.org/10.1159/000537865 Sidebar: I suspect this was not an oversight, but rather an attempt to avoid undermining their own bullish outlook by analyzing an implanted brain device that has failed to cross $2b in run rate; as Schalk et al wrote earlier this year , “30 years after the introduction of DBS, only less than 3% of patients with Parkinson disease receive a DBS implant.” For sake of understanding this close proxy market however, I dug up recent average US DBS costs from Bishay et al’s 2024 Review . In that paper, the chart to the left is followed by another chart that reveals how DBS costs vary by indication, from Parkinson’s to Essential Tremor or Dystonia. This variability underscores that no medical device is a monolith, and hints at the complexity of neurotechnology pricing and reimbursement strategy. BCI costs will prove highly heterogeneous, between incomparable device designs, surgical approaches, clinical protocols, intended functionality, and much more. Morgan Stanley’s report reflects this across various market segment analyses, but the authors keep the math simple with a low tier and high tier pricepoint. Let’s dive in. Humanizing the Market Authors segment BCI into broad categories of product and market, and defining and sizing immediate and follow-on markets for each. There are some limitations inherent to any market research of this scope which we’ll touch on at the end. While the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will need to determine appropriate coverage (reimbursement), they offer some ballpark estimates for sake of calculation: Enabling BCIs - Estimated price $60k : Restore function and communication due to neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, or injury. Preventative BCIs - Estimated price $30k : Mitigate or stop diseases or conditions such as depression to epilepsy. Initially, these may relay on existing codes for neurostimulation devices like those mentioned below, before new codes are approved. The cross sections between “Enable/Prevent” and “Early/Intermediate,” makes the analysis a little byzantine, but the math really comes down to which people will have skin in the game. Morgan Stanley's estimates for immediate BCI applications across 8 clinical indications Morgan Stanley Research Eight major market segments each feature an estimated population analysis that includes sizing rationale for both early-stage and intermediate-stage applications. A summary of the former suggests a near-term TAM of $80.8 billion (see above). The latter comprises a larger follow-on market opportunity worth up to $320 billion. Some key assumptions and estimates behind the larger, intermediate TAM figures: Motor Neuron Disease & Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - $2.25 billion: Around 40,000 people in the US live with a MND, including 30,000 with ALS, with roughly 6,000 new diagnoses each year. Of this group, about 12,500 have critical upper limb impairment, representing an early BCI market, while about 25,000 people with “moderate upper and/or critical lower limb impairment” represent the follow-on market opportunity. Stroke, Locked-In Syndrome - $48.6 billion : “There are less than 1,000 known cases of LIS in the US. There are roughly 900,000 strokes per year in the US, while 16% of these patients die, about a third of survivors will have a disability. We think about 5% of stroke cases result in a serious form of brain damage, which limits either speech or movement in a major way.” Spinal Cord Injury - $10.8 billion : Around 300,000 people in the US are living with a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), with about 20,000 new cases occurring each year. Authors estimate about 45,000 of these patients who have severe upper limb impairment represent early BCI adopters. Longer term, BCI integrated with spinal cord stimulation could represent another 135,000 people. ONWARD is leading here, while Neuralink has mentioned animal models of spinal cord stimulation are in R&D. As a note, the above three areas are fairly well established in the BCI industry, with Synchron , Neuralink , and Blackrock in active clinical trials, with Precision and Paradromics set to join them following FDA Breakthrough designations last year. Multiple Sclerosis - $9.45 billion : Around 1 million people have MS, with about 7,000 new diagnoses each year. Morgan Stanley estimates about 7,500 of these folks would opt for a BCI. Cerebral Palsy - $5.1 billion : Of the 500,000 adults in the US living with cerebral palsy today, about 5,000 have severe upper limb impairment, while about 80,000 live with moderate upper or severe lower limb impairment. Limb Amputation - $4.5 billion : There's roughly 2.5 million people in the US living with limb loss, with an additional 180k requiring amputation each year. Approximately 40% are missing an upper limb (upper arm, forearm and hand), representing initial BCI adopters. Phantom Limb pain could represent a follow-on market here as well, with companies like Phantom and Bios developing solutions. Epilepsy - $75 billion : About 3 million adults in the US suffer from epilepsy, with about 150,000 potentially eligible for a BCI to treat severe seizures in the short-term. Synchron has indicated interest in expanding here and Parkinson’s (which is mystifyingly absent from this report) Depression - $242.5 billion : About 21 million people have depression, and about 2.5 million live with severe, treatment-resistant depression, representing the BCI opportunity here. The authors note this application would probably have a lower price point of around $25,000. Of the companies today, Motif is actively pursuing a solution here, and Medtronic DBS implants are also being explored. While the authors suggest additional indications like ADHD, OCD, anxiety could become BCI markets, they stop short of scoping these opportunities in this analysis. What vs So What Beyond the above analysis, the report also explores eligible population growth projections, timelines for ramp up, penetration rates, and sales estimates on the early/intermediate rationale defined above for each condition. It’s tidy yet squishy math that doesn’t summarize neatly. After spending a day poring through these numbers and a year studying this market, here are parting thoughts for executives keen on digesting this report to inform their go-to-market strategy in BCI. Focus on 2030 . The utility of 20-year economic models for a pre-commercial market analysis plateaus the further out you go; predicting revenue in 2045 for a group of companies that have not yet implanted a single human being is somewhat hollow. The numbers in this report seem eye-popping by design, but they represent the total attainable market. At the risk of offering basic advice: diligence on a company’s product/market fit, electrode design, read/write considerations, available clinical data, competition (from BCI, neurotech, pharma, digital health, and beyond) and economic evidence generation strategy for the next 5 years are a better use of your firm’s brainpower than guessing what Elon will be doing with Neuralink on Mars in his 70’s. Understand Lead Indications . The report’s most salient analysis is the market segmentation, which can add real value to today’s discussions by creating a lingua franca of eligible patients. But what matters more today than refining guesstimates on average selling price and penetration rates, is understanding the unmet needs of populations living with neurodegenerative diseases, physical injuries, and psychiatric indications. BCI can certainly add value to people living with motor impairment, but the double- and triple-click into understanding costs and benefits alongside medications, caregivers, other assistive and digital technologies is the broader economic puzzle. Do Your Own Research . Big numbers aside, there’s a lot missing in this report. Vision Restoration is not mentioned at all, despite at least three companies active there. Same with DBS and Parkinson’s, where InBRAIN’s FDA Breakthrough signals possible competition with Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott as a potential “DBS 2.0.” I’m nitpicking, but the authors also mistakenly list Neurable’s EEG headphones as a BCI (it’s just not), while leaving out Axoft , Vonova and others that certainly are. Moreover, the panoply of implantable neurotechnologies might arguably be better investment opportunities with crossover potential into these same markets. For a report focused on long-term outlook, this is somewhat thin on the wealth of technologies, approaches, and rapid commercial R&D today. Follow The Pioneers - The finance bros did a great job with the spreadsheet, but they don’t know it all, especially when it comes to technology’s role in living with disability. It’s stunning to me that this report doesn’t feature the word “Medicaid” once. Recent papers authored by Ian Burkhart , Jen French , and stalwart colleagues hold insights, recommendations, and boatloads of footnotes, data supplements, technical specs, and real-world implications for utilization, usability, product design and beyond. If you really want to understand the opportunity and challenge of serving this market, just start with stories like this one . I’d argue you’ll learn more about evaluating odds of market success than you will from the size of a TAM. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

Boeing to cut 10% workforce, delay 777X delivery as strike takes toll | Workers' Rights News | Al Jazeera A month into a worker strike, Boeing announced new losses [File: David Ryder/Reuters] Published On 11 Oct 2024 11 Oct 2024 United States-based plane maker Boeing will cut 17,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its global workforce, delay first delivery of its 777X jet by a year and announced substantial new losses in its defence business as a monthlong strike batters company finances, CEO Kelly Ortberg has said. On Friday, in a message to employees, Ortberg said the company must reset its workforce levels “to align with our financial reality” after a strike by 33,000 US West Coast workers shuttered production of its 737 MAX, 767 and 777 jets. “We reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and to a more focused set of priorities. Over the coming months, we are planning to reduce the size of our total workforce by roughly 10 percent. These reductions will include executives, managers and employees,” Ortberg’s message said. Boeing shares fell 2.3 percent in after-market trading. Ortberg also said Boeing has notified customers that the company now expects the first delivery of its 777X in 2026 due to the challenges it has faced in development, as well as the flight-test pause and ongoing work stoppage. Boeing had already faced issues with the certification of the 777X that had significantly delayed the plane’s launch. Boeing, which reports its third-quarter earnings on October 23, said in a separate release it now expects revenue of $17.8bn, a loss per share of $9.97, and negative operating cash flow of $1.3bn. “While our business is facing near-term challenges, we are making important strategic decisions for our future and have a clear view on the work we must do to restore our company,” Ortberg added in a statement. Boeing will end its 767 freighter programme in 2027 when it completes and delivers the remaining 29 planes ordered but said production for the KC-46A tanker will continue. Ratings concern Reaching a deal to end the work stoppage is critical for Boeing. Ratings agency S&P estimated the strike is costing it $1bn a month and it is at risk of losing its prized investment-grade credit rating. Earlier this week, talks hit an impasse , and Boeing withdrew its pay offer to about 33,000 US factory workers, saying the union did not consider its proposals seriously after two days of talks. The company said, in light of the job cuts, it would end a furlough programme for salaried employees announced in September. Even before the strike began on September 13, the company had been burning cash as it struggled to recover from a January midair panel blowout on a new plane that exposed weak safety protocols and spurred US regulators to curb its production. The Reuters news agency reported this week Boeing is examining options to raise billions of dollars through a sale of stock and equity-like securities. The company has about $60bn in debt and posted operating cash flow losses of more than $7bn for the first half of 2024. Analysts estimate that Boeing would need to raise between $10bn and $15bn to maintain its ratings, which are now one notch above junk, or non-investment-grade and have a higher risk of default.

A new era of monetary policy 2022 will be remembered as the year where no asset class was spared. The correlation between fixed income and equities was at its highest as the S&P 500 dropped 19.44% and the global aggregate credit index lost almost 16.96%. This positive relationship was unusual, as it defied economic textbooks and portfolio theory. The reason for this market behavior was of course the fast-paced hiking cycle to rein in inflation which triggered the market collapse even though the economy was growing. As we enter the rate cutting cycle in both Europe and the US, can central banks reverse engineer this process? What can we expect from the markets in the near future? Go deeper with GlobalData Reports Global Macroeconomic Outlook - Q2 2023 Update Reports Global Risk Report Quarterly Update - Q4 2022 Data Insights The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more European Space Agency SA View all Past cycles When the ‘Dot.com’ bubble burst between March 2000 and July 2002, equities (represented by the S&P500) shed 50.0% of their value, while Bonds (represented by the global aggregate credit index) were up 29.7%. Through this period the Fed reduced the overnight rate by almost 500 bps to help support an economy reeling from recession. In fact, bonds compensated most of the losses experienced by equities and balanced portfolios held up relatively well. Contrary to 2022, rates acted as a shock absorber for equities. During the GFC 2008, from September 2007 until March 2009, equities fell 57% while bonds also dropped 10% due to credit widening and defaults. The risk-free US 10-year note however was up 4.3%. The negative correlation is evident, the reason is simple: In 2000 and 2008, markets acting as a precursor to economic well-being dropped sharply, the economy fell into recession which brought about the easing of monetary policy, in contrast to many of the 2022 market behaviors. In textbook fashion, bonds acted as a defensive asset class in the face of crumbling equity markets. Which leads us to today, as we draw lessons from the past and try to predict, with some degree of accuracy, the future. Front loading cuts Now is the first time in the 2000s that the Fed is cutting rates by 50 bps with no recession in sight, and only the second time in modern history. This could be seen as both a pre-emptive measure against a slowing job market and a readjustment of real yields since inflation targets have been achieved. There is little reason to keep a restrictive monetary policy with inflation well below 3% and stable, so the Fed has taken the decision to cut hard now, leaving room for more maneuverability down the line. Keeping the monetary lag in mind, the effect of this cut will only be felt in six to twelve months’ time, in other words, it could be too late to stimulate the economy should they need to. So far, markets have reacted positively to the “bold” move. At the time of writing, US and European equities are flirting with record highs, bond markets are stable and high yield spreads at historical lows. As long as consumer spending remains strong and GDP growth on track, there is no reason to believe that we will see a repeat of previous crises. On the contrary, we could have both the bond market and equities performing strongly. How well do you really know your competitors?

Small to medium size companies stand to benefit most from rate cuts as it will directly impact their access to cheaper capital. Hence, we could see a rotation out of cash rich companies and mega caps, who will be earning less year on year on their substantial cash piles, than the broader market. High yielding dividend stocks also become more attractive on improved relative value versus the risk-free rate. The recent yield curve inversion however indicates that gains from fixed income investments will be limited to cash flow generated from holding debt. Capital appreciation caused by further compression of interest rates is unlikely and cuts are discounted. Risks to inflation have not completely dissipated as potential new trade wars and expansionary fiscal policy pose unforeseen risk on prices. A treacherous path It is going to be a very interesting twelve months ahead with markets expecting 175 bps cuts to reach 3%, the neutral rate. The path however is bumpy and rarely goes in a straight line. Times ahead are challenging, geopolitical risks are rising, but not necessarily priced in, we are also awaiting the US elections and its implication on fiscal policy, and an uncertain job market, to mention a few risks ahead. But in the meantime, as long as the music plays, the party goes on.

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Samchem Holdings Berhad (KLSE:SAMCHEM)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 7:41 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 With its stock down 12% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Samchem Holdings Berhad (KLSE:SAMCHEM). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Samchem Holdings Berhad's ROE today. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Samchem Holdings Berhad How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Samchem Holdings Berhad is: 11% = RM36m ÷ RM321m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every MYR1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated MYR0.11 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Samchem Holdings Berhad's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE At first glance, Samchem Holdings Berhad's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, the fact that the its ROE is quite higher to the industry average of 5.2% doesn't go unnoticed by us. However, Samchem Holdings Berhad's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 2.7%. Bear in mind, the company does have a low ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is lower. Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Samchem Holdings Berhad's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 16% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Samchem Holdings Berhad fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Samchem Holdings Berhad Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 41% (or a retention ratio of 59% over the past three years, Samchem Holdings Berhad has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline. Moreover, Samchem Holdings Berhad has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Conclusion In total, it does look like Samchem Holdings Berhad has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a moderate ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. While we won't completely dismiss the company, what we would do, is try to ascertain how risky the business is to make a more informed decision around the company. Our risks dashboard would have the 2 risks we have identified for Samchem Holdings Berhad. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Advertisement BlackRock became the world's largest asset manager because it made cheap funds for the masses. Now, the $11.5 trillion behemoth wants to put high-fee private market strategies in your portfolio. The firm brought in more assets last quarter — $221 billion — than ever before, but on its earnings call, the firm's leaders focused more on integrating strategies from the recent acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners into model portfolios than on its ballooning ETF franchise. "This is a revenue growth story," said BlackRock's chief financial officer Martin Small Friday morning. GIP, the infrastructure asset manager that BlackRock paid $12.5 billion for, is expected to add $250 million in management fees to BlackRock's bottom line in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a meaningful accelerant to our private markets capabilities," he said. Advertisement A quarter century after BlackRock went public — the firm IPOed on October 1, 1999 — the firm hopes to blend its private market strategies into its model portfolios for wealth managers. Private equity and private credit strategies have the potential to bring on higher returns but are also less liquid and more expensive investments than mutual funds or ETFs. The manager is hoping to be the builder of next-generation technology, whether that's data centers needed for artificial intelligence or infrastructure needed for decarbonization. "We're not going to say they're alternatives because they'll just be part of the market," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, about private strategies, which have long been touted in industry lingo as "alternatives" to the public market. Related stories Fink said risk will be measured by the liquidity of these blended portfolios. The firm's $3.2 billion acquisition of data giant Preqin will help bring these more complex strategies to a broader audience. The acquisition is set to close at the end of the year. "It's going to happen with the expansion of data and analytics," Fink said. Advertisement The firm's focus may be shifting because there aren't many more levers to pull for increased growth in its iShares franchise, which crossed $1 trillion in total assets last quarter. The firm's leaders said the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong one for this segment of their business, and the franchise has also seen serious inflows following political events and central bank decisions. Comparatively, retail allocation to the private markets is in the "low-single digits," according to Small, giving BlackRock another territory to expand into. "The opportunities ahead of us have never been better than they are now," Fink said. Private credit, for example, could pick up billions of dollars from the firm's insurance clients, which have $700 billion invested with BlackRock. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," Fink said, and private market strategies are the latest roll of the dice.

US PE firm Kaho Partners targets M&A in international cuisine Credit: Suzanne Pratt / Shutterstock After selling US pie maker Kenny’s Great Pies earlier this year, private-equity firm Kaho Partners is embarking on its next move on food. Managing partner Griffin Horter is leading Global Flavors Group, a newly-established “platform” to buy manufacturers of Mediterranean, Asian, Indian and Hispanic foods. Go deeper with GlobalData Reports PepsiCo Indonesia - Failure Case Study Data Insights The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more He tells Just Food Kaho Partners is in talks with potential sellers and expects to finalise its first deal within the next 12 months. Dean Best (DB): What’s sparked Kaho Partners’ interest in the market for international cuisine in the US? Griffin Horter (GH): There are two tailwinds we’re investing behind. One is increasing diversity [in the US population] but the second, which I think is actually more powerful, is the growing interest in authentic international flavours from the overall US population. Every US citizen is being exposed to more people from different backgrounds, therefore more restaurants with international cuisines are opening in the US. You go to a grocery store, there’s more international food in the grocery store. There was a great study that came out recently that interviewed a large group of Gen Z people and the question was: if you could eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be? And the answer was Mexican. The traditional answer to that question for the last 20 or 30 years had been Italian food. That used to be seen as international or ethnic but now it’s mainstream in the US. The fact that 45% of Gen Z respondents said that Mexican would be the one cuisine they would eat for the rest of their lives shows you that this is a trend for the overall population. See Also: Entangled Capital buys majority stake in Martino couscous owner Bikaji Foods to buy majority stake in The Hazelnut Factory DB: Kaho Partners said it is looking for businesses generating less than $10m of profit. Why is that? GH : We have pinned it at that level because we’re looking for small, nimble, growing companies. We’re not looking for companies that have already reached the scale where a PepsiCo might buy them as an example . Our vision here is that we’re not looking to buy one company. We’re looking to buy a handful, two handfuls of businesses over the next five to eight years so that we can have a portfolio of manufacturing assets and be the one-stop solution, one-stop shop, for these retailers to come to us for their authentic international cuisine needs.

GH : I would say it’s spread across them evenly to start with. What that means is I’m looking at companies in all of those cuisines today but, once we make the first acquisition, our focus for the platform will be on that cuisine. For instance, if the first company we buy is a Hispanic food manufacturer, then the platform is going to be focused on Hispanic food. DB: Are you in any live discussions at the moment? GH : Yes, I’m in a number of them. DB: When do you expect the first deal to be announced? GH : That is really hard to guess because most of the companies I’m in conversations with, they’re not auction processes, right? Those transactions can take a while because it’s kind of like dating. My hope is in the next six to 12 months. That’s my expectation. DB: What other attributes would interesting businesses have to have for Global Flavors Group? GH : The most important thing is they have to do their own manufacturing. We’re not looking to acquire brands that outsource their manufacturing. We’re looking to acquire companies that are great at sufficiently manufacturing authentic international cuisine. That’s number one. Number two is we want them to be focused on a small group of products. We don’t want to acquire a company that is making 600 different products. We want companies that are small, that are focused on a small handful of products, and are leaders in those products. DB: What current retail distribution would they have to have to get Kaho Partners interested in talking to them? GH: We would like to see companies that have broken into mainstream retail. International cuisine has traditionally gone to market through specialised retailers, which tend to be smaller stores. As these manufacturing companies get bigger, they can break into what’s referred to as mainstream retail, which tends to be customers like Sam’s Club, Walmart, Kroger, H-E-B. We want to acquire companies that are on that journey, who have already broken into mainstream retail but likely need help breaking into additional large national retail chains. DB: Similar to the profitability benchmark, is there a level of sales you’re looking for? GH: No, there isn’t. We’re just focused on making sure that the companies are profitable and that they’re less than $10m in profit. DB: Given the fragmentation of the category, to what extent do you think that makes it harder to choose the right acquisition? GH : I think it makes it easier for us. When we look for an industry to build a business in, fragmentation is one of the top two criteria we look for alongside growth tailwinds in an industry. We don’t want to focus on an industry that only has ten companies. Then you have to buy one of those ten. We want to look at industries that are very fragmented, so that we can look at 100 companies and find the best two or three to start with. DB: What’s your assessment of the overall M&A environment in US food at the moment? GH : I think that now is a very good time to be both buying and selling food businesses. I think what the pandemic taught buyers in the space is that one of the reasons we like food is people think that it’s recession-resilient. We saw that during Covid. Even when there are downturns in the economy, people still need to buy food. Kaho Partners managing partner Griffin Horter M&A activity was very slow from call it ‘21 to ‘23 because there was some demand destruction due to Covid and then, when demand came back, there was hyperinflation, and all the companies were dealing with cost issues. A lot of the big acquirers, both strategics and private-equity funds, took a year or two off. We’re seeing a lot of activity in the M&A markets in the food space this year. I think a good example of that is our pie company. We got a ton of interest, much more interest than I expected to get to that business and that’s because a lot of buyers really wanted to play capital behind food. DB: What level of funding do you have at your disposal for this platform? GH: We partner with family offices because we like to build businesses over five to eight years. In order to do that, you can’t raise a private-equity fund, because if you do that, you can only spend three to five years building a business. What we will do for this one is partner with some of our existing family offices, and then our partnership, Kaho Partners, will invest a lot of money into the deal as well. It’s the money that’s coming from our partnership and then from our family office relationships. DB: Are you able to give me a dollar figure? GH : No, I can’t unfortunately. DB: A lot could happen between now and then, obviously, but after that, five- to eight-year period, you’ll be looking to exit and sell on to either another PE firm or a potential interested buyer in the trade? GH : Well, there are three potential outcomes. One is we sell to a private-equity fund. To be frank, this thesis we have in international cuisine isn’t rocket science. I like to tell people that this is a simple but very powerful idea. A lot of other people see these trends. One of the reasons we like this space is the bigger private-equity funds see this trend but there aren’t many scaled players. It’s a fragmented space and there are a lot of small companies but the companies are so small that most private-equity funds can’t buy them. You have a lot of big private equity funds who want to invest in this theme but there aren’t many scaled players. We’re going to build a scaled player. I’m confident there will be a lot of interest from private equity in five to eight years. I’m also confident there will be a lot of interest from strategic acquirers in five to eight years. Those are our first two outcomes. We can settle one of those two. The third outcome is, if this is going really well and we believe in the growth story, we could keep holding the business, whether that’s through our existing investor base of family offices, which have a long-term investment horizon, or taking the company public. It’s difficult to say today. The good thing is we’ve optionality. DB: Is Kaho Partners looking to invest in any other parts of the food industry? GH : No. We’re very focused. We’re an investment partnership. We only build three or four companies at a time. This is the only company that we’re currently looking at platforms for. We’re not going to start a new business for the next probably four or five years. This is our focus in the food and beverage space.

BlackRock's assets hit record $11.5 trillion amid private market push Read full article Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia Updated Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 11:10 PM 3 min read Link Copied 4 In this article: By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working," Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. "Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth," Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but "relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. Story continues "The combination of a strong ETF franchise, an expansion into private markets, a favorable market tailwind, and contributions from acquisitions combined to widen the moat around BlackRock,” said Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA.

Boeing to cut 10% workforce, delay 777X delivery as strike takes toll | Workers' Rights News | Al Jazeera A month into a worker strike, Boeing announced new losses [File: David Ryder/Reuters] Published On 11 Oct 2024 11 Oct 2024 United States-based plane maker Boeing will cut 17,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its global workforce, delay first delivery of its 777X jet by a year and announced substantial new losses in its defence business as a monthlong strike batters company finances, CEO Kelly Ortberg has said. On Friday, in a message to employees, Ortberg said the company must reset its workforce levels “to align with our financial reality” after a strike by 33,000 US West Coast workers shuttered production of its 737 MAX, 767 and 777 jets. “We reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and to a more focused set of priorities. Over the coming months, we are planning to reduce the size of our total workforce by roughly 10 percent. These reductions will include executives, managers and employees,” Ortberg’s message said. Boeing shares fell 2.3 percent in after-market trading. Ortberg also said Boeing has notified customers that the company now expects the first delivery of its 777X in 2026 due to the challenges it has faced in development, as well as the flight-test pause and ongoing work stoppage. Boeing had already faced issues with the certification of the 777X that had significantly delayed the plane’s launch. Boeing, which reports its third-quarter earnings on October 23, said in a separate release it now expects revenue of $17.8bn, a loss per share of $9.97, and negative operating cash flow of $1.3bn. “While our business is facing near-term challenges, we are making important strategic decisions for our future and have a clear view on the work we must do to restore our company,” Ortberg added in a statement. Boeing will end its 767 freighter programme in 2027 when it completes and delivers the remaining 29 planes ordered but said production for the KC-46A tanker will continue. Ratings concern Reaching a deal to end the work stoppage is critical for Boeing. Ratings agency S&P estimated the strike is costing it $1bn a month and it is at risk of losing its prized investment-grade credit rating. Earlier this week, talks hit an impasse , and Boeing withdrew its pay offer to about 33,000 US factory workers, saying the union did not consider its proposals seriously after two days of talks. The company said, in light of the job cuts, it would end a furlough programme for salaried employees announced in September. Even before the strike began on September 13, the company had been burning cash as it struggled to recover from a January midair panel blowout on a new plane that exposed weak safety protocols and spurred US regulators to curb its production. The Reuters news agency reported this week Boeing is examining options to raise billions of dollars through a sale of stock and equity-like securities. The company has about $60bn in debt and posted operating cash flow losses of more than $7bn for the first half of 2024. Analysts estimate that Boeing would need to raise between $10bn and $15bn to maintain its ratings, which are now one notch above junk, or non-investment-grade and have a higher risk of default.

The bull market is 2 years old. Here's where Wall Street thinks stocks go next. Read full article Josh Schafer · Reporter Updated Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 9:47 AM 5 min read Link Copied 669 In this article: The bull market in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) began two years ago and is showing few signs of slowing. Backed by the rise of artificial intelligence euphoria and a surprisingly resilient US economy , the S&P 500 has gained more than 60% in the past two years and is hovering near an all-time high. Wall Street strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance believe the bull can keep running wild. Barring any unexpected shocks, the path higher appears to be clear, with earnings growth expected to keep accelerating and the economy on seemingly solid footing as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. A bull market for the S&P 500 was officially declared in June 2023 when the index rose 20% from its recent bear market low. History says this bull market still has legs. At two years, the bull market is well shy of the average run of 5.5 years. And the total return thus far, about 60%, is a far cry from the average 180% gain, per research from Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. In the past few weeks, several Wall Street equity strategists have made the case for the benchmark index to rise further into both year-end and into 2025, supported by accelerating earnings for the S&P 500. "We continue to be surprised by the strength of market gains and decided yet again that something more than an incremental adjustment was warranted," BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote in a September note when raising his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to a Street high of 6,100 from a previous target of 5,600. On Oct. 4, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target to 6,000 and initiated a 12-month target of 6,300. Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin did note, though, that already high valuations could limit the upside for how far the index can reach in 2025. Risks to the rally Strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance agreed with Kostin that already stretched valuations present a challenge to how much higher stocks can go. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon noted that dating back to the mid-1960s, the only time valuations have been this stretched on a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio were 2021 and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. "This would tell you that the bull is much older or somewhat near the end of this life," Gordon said. But strategists often warn that a high valuation itself isn't a proper tool for calling the end of a bull market. Stocks can trade at what are considered to be expensive valuations for longer than expected. What that does tell investors is that much of the good news that could push stocks higher might've already been priced in. Story continues "If you look at what the market's discounting right now, we'd say front and center, a big chunk of what's being priced in is a soft landing sentiment," Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. Charging Bull statue by Arturo Di Modica is seen in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York, on July 4, 2024. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images) Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz noted that high valuations themselves aren't why bull markets end. There needs to be a catalyst. He explained there are two common reasons market drawdowns happen: a spike in interest rates or a rise in the unemployment rate. With inflation well off the boil of 2022 and the recent increase in unemployment stalling out , neither of the two downside catalysts are clearly in view. There could, of course, be a surprise no one sees coming. But "it's a little bit harder to see where the shock comes from," Chronert said. "If things continue to play out incrementally, investors can handle a little bit of a change [to the economic narrative] here, a little bit of a change there ... It's when you get a more immediate unraveling, and it's hard to really say that immediate unraveling is going to come." This sets the market up for a narrative shift. To Kantrowitz, the currently expensive valuations show that the bull market is likely moving from a macro-driven environment, where factors like inflation falling and other signs of economic resilience have pushed stocks higher, to one that is more based on the fundamentals. "For this market to continue moving higher, and particularly to determine what stocks lead, it's going to be all about earnings," Kantrowitz said. The bar for earnings remains high. Consensus estimates project earnings to grow nearly 10% in 2024 and almost 15% in 2025. The key for investors remains finding which sectors are seeing earnings growth accelerate rather than just staying steady. And , according to Chronert, part of that story could come down to the two letters that defined the first part of the bull market : AI. Chronert, who said his team is still a holder of the "Magnificent Seven" tech cohort , doesn't doubt that the AI narrative will continue to manifest itself in the market. But after significant gains seen in those tech stocks over the past two years amid large earnings growth, focus may continue to shift to the broadening impact of AI on companies that aren't making the AI chips or the cloud servers operating the new technology. For AI to continue to have broader impact on the market and keep pushing earnings growth for the index above expectations, "you've got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins [and] profitability metrics," Chronert said. He added, "It would be that sort of thesis that has to play out, and that's going to take two to five years." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer .

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Samchem Holdings Berhad (KLSE:SAMCHEM)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 7:41 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 With its stock down 12% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Samchem Holdings Berhad (KLSE:SAMCHEM). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Samchem Holdings Berhad's ROE today. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Samchem Holdings Berhad How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Samchem Holdings Berhad is: 11% = RM36m ÷ RM321m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every MYR1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated MYR0.11 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Samchem Holdings Berhad's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE At first glance, Samchem Holdings Berhad's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, the fact that the its ROE is quite higher to the industry average of 5.2% doesn't go unnoticed by us. However, Samchem Holdings Berhad's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 2.7%. Bear in mind, the company does have a low ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is lower. Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Samchem Holdings Berhad's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 16% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Samchem Holdings Berhad fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Samchem Holdings Berhad Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 41% (or a retention ratio of 59% over the past three years, Samchem Holdings Berhad has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline. Moreover, Samchem Holdings Berhad has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Conclusion In total, it does look like Samchem Holdings Berhad has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a moderate ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. While we won't completely dismiss the company, what we would do, is try to ascertain how risky the business is to make a more informed decision around the company. Our risks dashboard would have the 2 risks we have identified for Samchem Holdings Berhad. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Macquarie Technology Group Limited (ASX:MAQ)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 1:44 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Macquarie Technology Group (ASX:MAQ) has had a rough three months with its share price down 10%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Macquarie Technology Group's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Macquarie Technology Group How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Macquarie Technology Group is: 7.2% = AU$33m ÷ AU$455m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.07. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. Macquarie Technology Group's Earnings Growth And 7.2% ROE When you first look at it, Macquarie Technology Group's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 6.4%. Having said that, Macquarie Technology Group has shown a modest net income growth of 14% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Macquarie Technology Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Macquarie Technology Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Macquarie Technology Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Macquarie Technology Group doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen. Summary In total, it does look like Macquarie Technology Group has some positive aspects to its business. That is, a decent growth in earnings backed by a high rate of reinvestment. However, we do feel that that earnings growth could have been higher if the business were to improve on the low ROE rate. Especially given how the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more. Have feedback on this article?

Bega Cheese Limited (ASX:BGA) Stock Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead ? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 11:51 PM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Bega Cheese (ASX:BGA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 23% over the last three months. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Bega Cheese's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Bega Cheese How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Bega Cheese is: 3.0% = AU$31m ÷ AU$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.03 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. A Side By Side comparison of Bega Cheese's Earnings Growth And 3.0% ROE It is quite clear that Bega Cheese's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 8.0%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 51% seen by Bega Cheese was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio. So, as a next step, we compared Bega Cheese's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 3.3% over the last few years. past-earnings-growth The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is BGA worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether BGA is currently mispriced by the market. Story continues Is Bega Cheese Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 36% (that is, a retention ratio of 64%), the fact that Bega Cheese's earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline. Moreover, Bega Cheese has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Bega Cheese's future ROE will rise to 7.6% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE. Conclusion Overall, we have mixed feelings about Bega Cheese. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Vita Life Sciences Limited's (ASX:VLS) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 11:35 PM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Most readers would already know that Vita Life Sciences' (ASX:VLS) stock increased by 4.6% over the past month. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Vita Life Sciences' ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Vita Life Sciences How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vita Life Sciences is: 19% = AU$9.4m ÷ AU$49m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.19 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Vita Life Sciences' Earnings Growth And 19% ROE To start with, Vita Life Sciences' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Vita Life Sciences' decent 20% net income growth seen over the past five years. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Vita Life Sciences' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 35% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Vita Life Sciences is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Story continues Is Vita Life Sciences Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? With a three-year median payout ratio of 45% (implying that the company retains 55% of its profits), it seems that Vita Life Sciences is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered. Besides, Vita Life Sciences has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Summary Overall, we are quite pleased with Vita Life Sciences' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Not to forget, share price outcomes are also dependent on the potential risks a company may face. So it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved in the business. Our risks dashboard would have the 3 risks we have identified for Vita Life Sciences. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Tackling information overload in the age of AI Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Windows 11 Microsoft Apple Linux Cloud ChatGPT AI Security Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Tackling information overload in the age of AI By Chandini Jain Published 1 week ago No Comments Tweet Agile decision-making is often hampered by the volume and complexity of unstructured data. That’s where AI can help. In 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which allocated billions in investment to clean energy. This set off a race among private equity and credit firms to identify potential beneficiaries -- the companies throughout the clean energy supply chain that may need additional capital to take advantage of the new opportunities the IRA would create. It turned out to be quite a data challenge. Clean energy supply chains are an intricate network of tens of thousands of companies that produce and process raw materials, manufacture and install equipment, generate and transmit clean energy, and lead the development of large and complex clean energy projects. Private markets firms struggle with data just like every knowledge-intensive organization -- those in the business of collecting, creating, and applying knowledge. There are highly skilled and compensated professionals in every one of these organizations who must work with the data to solve problems and make informed decisions. For private equity and credit, this kind of data work answers strategic questions: Can we identify deals quickly and engage before other firms? Can we screen out poor fits quickly and move on? Can we conduct thorough due diligence quickly and close fast? There are many private companies and good data on them is hard to come by. However, there’s far more information about them than ever before due to the explosion of digital media, and it’s usually hidden in noise. Private company operations have also grown more complex over time as their ability to source materials and market their products from around the world has increased considerably. There’s more information to understand about the risks and opportunities associated with any given company. The problem for knowledge professionals such as those in private markets is that while they excel at analyzing data, complex reasoning, and using those insights to make decisions, they just aren’t spending much of their time doing those things. Rather, they’re bogged down by tedious and repetitive data work, $200-per-hour workers performing $20-per-hour work. Information overload is the default state of today’s knowledge worker, who invests much of his or her time managing it in highly inefficient ways because there’s been no alternative available. The Problem: Unstructured Data In private markets, this means professionals spend much of their time sourcing and sifting through reams of company filings, news articles, lawsuits, shipping data, sustainability reports in the form of web pages, PDFs, documents, charts, and images. In healthcare, it’s patient data, medical research, and protocols. In law, it’s legal documents, case law, and evidence. The story is the same in engineering, scientific research, education, and many other industries. The reason this story is so universal is that the kind of information that drives knowledge-intensive workflows is unstructured data, which has stubbornly resisted the automation wave that has taken on so many other enterprise workflows using software and software-as-a-service (SaaS). SaaS has empowered teams with tools they can use to efficiently manage a wide variety of workflows involving structured data. However, SaaS offerings have been unable to take on the core “jobs to be done” in the knowledge-intensive enterprise because they can’t read and understand unstructured data. They aren’t capable of performing human-like services with autonomous decision-making abilities. As a result, knowledge workers are still stuck doing a lot of monotonous and undifferentiated data work. However, newly available large language models (LLMs) and generative AI excel at processing and extracting meaning from unstructured data. LLM-powered “AI agents” can perform services such as reading and summarizing content and prioritizing work and can automate multistage knowledge workflows autonomously. Tech analyst Benedict Evans describes these AI agents as “infinite interns.” Consider all of the $20-per-hour jobs to be done in knowledge-based organizations -- work ideally suited for bright and capable interns to take on -- if only recruiting, training, and managing such a large group of interns was economically feasible. Armed with an “infinite number of interns” in the form of generative AI agents or “copilots,” it is now economically feasible to liberate knowledge workers from tedious and repetitive data work so they can focus on what they do best: higher-value analysis and strategic decision-making. Challenges However, deploying a virtual army of AI agents is not without its challenges, and it can’t be accomplished using LLMs alone. Although the data used to train leading LLMs is massive, those LLMs lack access to the domain-specific data required for enterprise workflows. That’s why tools such as ChatGPT are unsuitable. They are great at producing well-written responses, but they can’t give us the answers we need, and they tend to hallucinate. By integrating information retrieval-based models with LLMs (generative models), it is possible to build and deploy generative AI tools that can access external data and limit output to only information derived from that data. A technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can be used to autonomously handle complex knowledge-intensive workflows where accuracy and trust requirements are high and output needs to be appropriately fine-tuned for specific use cases. In our private markets example, professionals will leverage “infinite interns” to sift through the constant flow of news, filings, and other company data so they can focus on identifying and prescreening potential deals faster, conducting due diligence quickly and efficiently, and surfacing risks before they blow up into front-page controversies. Generative AI will bring a platform shift in the knowledge-intensive enterprise comparable in its potential impact to the transformative role of cloud computing and SaaS over the past two decades and reshape the nature of knowledge work.

The Private Equity Firm Betting Big On Big Sky, Montana BETA THIS IS A BETA EXPERIENCE. OPT-OUT HERE Edit Story Forbes Billionaires Premium Editors' Pick The Private Equity Firm Betting Big On Big Sky, Montana Kerry A. Dolan Forbes Staff Kerry A. Dolan is a San Francisco-based editor covering billionaires. Following Oct 13, 2024, 06:30am EDT Updated Oct 14, 2024, 09:15pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Montage Big Sky hotel, opened in 2021 and owned by CrossHarbor Capital Partners' Montana arm. Courtesy of Lone Mountain Land Company Tucked behind one of the many doors to the main lodge at the exclusive Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Montana is a spacious lounge with comfy chairs, an array of snacks and cold drinks—and a 15 by 15 foot scale model of the club. It shows the club’s private ski mountain, its lush golf course and hundreds of numbered properties parceled throughout its 15,000 acres–all helpful in selling memberships. Sam Byrne, managing partner at Boston real estate investment firm CrossHarbor Capital, the club’s principal owner, proudly ticks through the amenities that his team has added to the uncrowded skiing and popular golf options at the club since purchasing it out of bankruptcy in 2009: a performance arts barn that hosts intimate concerts from global rock stars like Sting and the Doobie Brothers; high end restaurants like BaBa, run by Boston celebrity chef Ming Tsai; a night club; a fancy spa and more. “There’s nobody doing what we’re doing,” boasts Byrne. No other big ski resort town in the country has as dominant an investor as Big Sky does. In addition to buying the Yellowstone Club with partners 15 years ago for $115 million, CrossHarbor made two acquisitions in 2013, with the aim of developing more luxury homes in the area. It spent $26 million to buy Spanish Peaks Mountain Club, a ski and golf community on 5,700 acres that had also declared bankruptcy; and $32 million for Moonlight Basin, a ski resort and residential development that had also gone bankrupt and was owned by its creditor, Lehman Brothers Holdings. After the deals closed, CrossHarbor sold the ski terrains of both Spanish Peaks and Moonlight Basin to Boyne Resorts, the company that owns and operates the Big Sky ski mountain. It merged them into Big Sky Resort, turning it into one of the largest ski resorts in the country, with some 5,800 skiable acres. Altogether, CrossHarbor has spent at least $4 billion in Big Sky over the past 15 years via a mix of debt and equity. That includes acquiring 43,000 acres through the purchases of Yellowstone Club, Spanish Peaks, Moonlight Basin and land in the Big Sky’s town center, plus building homes, restaurants, two hotels and other amenities on them and buying and building workforce housing. After purchasing 500 acres from Bozeman’s Simkins family in 2022, CrossHarbor owns more than half of Big Sky’s town center, according to Matt Kidd, a CrossHarbor partner who runs the firm’s Montana subsidiary, Lone Mountain Land Company. That makes its Big Sky bets the biggest overall project for the 31-year-old firm, which has also invested nationwide in apartment complexes, office towers and retail centers. “CrossHarbor represents the [southwest Montana] region’s most significant private ownership and 75% of the local tax base,” the company said in its 2023 ESG report. CrossHarbor Capital's Matt Kidd (left) and Sam Byrne introduce the Doobie Brothers at a 2024 Labor Day weekend concert at the Yellowstone Club. Courtesy of the Yellowstone Club All this money has poured into a town of about 3,300 full time residents that is unincorporated–thus there is no mayor or city council. Most of Big Sky sits in Montana’s Gallatin County–except for the Yellowstone Club, which is part of neighboring Madison County. In addition to the Big Sky ski resort, Lone Mountain Land Company has the most at stake in the town–and has led Kidd, who lives full time in Big Sky with his wife and three children, to become something akin to the town’s unofficial mayor. “Their timing could not have been better. They’ve been riding a 15-year wave,” says Eric Ladd, who spent a decade on the sales and membership team at the Yellowstone Club before founding and chairing Outlaw Partners, a media, events and real estate firm in Big Sky in 2008. “We’ve had about 30 years of growth in less than a decade.” Byrne, 59, first got into real estate as a teenager, obtaining a license at age 17 to help sell homes at his mom’s real estate office near Marblehead, Massachusetts. He cofounded CrossHarbor Capital in Boston in 1993 to focus on commercial real estate private equity. It now has $10.2 billion in assets under management and additional offices in Chicago and Newport Beach, California. In 2020, CrossHarbor sold minority stakes in the firm to Dyal Capital Partners (now owned by Blue Owl), Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank of Japan and Singapore-headquartered private equity firm Hillhouse Capital. The firm’s investors include about 300 families or family offices, some of whom are Yellowstone Club members. CrossHarbor is somewhat cagey on its returns. Early backers in the Yellowstone Club have made about 4.5 times their invested capital. “Certainly the Yellowstone Club has been a financial success,” says Kidd, who joined CrossHarbor in 2008 specifically to work on the Yellowstone Club and has been running the firm’s Montana operations since then. As for the other Montana investments, he says “it should work out and our investors will be rewarded for their patience and their commitment.” CrossHarbor has also invested in apartment developments in places like Denver and Falls Church, Virginia; a 1-million-square-foot distribution center in Phoenix that’s leased to Amazon; and in open-air retail complexes in locations including Santa Rosa, California and Cranston, Rhode Island. The Yellowstone Club was founded by Tim Blixseth, an Oregon timber entrepreneur and former billionaire who bought 140,000 acres near Yellowstone National Park in 1991 and swapped them for the land to create the Yellowstone Club in 1999. Byrne, an avid skier, first visited a friend’s home at the club in the early 2000s, fell for the place and became a member in 2005. Two years later, CrossHarbor invested just under $55 million to buy a selection of lots at the club, and was in the process of buying the whole Yellowstone Club for an additional $455 million. That deal ended up falling apart. It later came to light that Blixseth, who had borrowed $375 million for the club from Credit Suisse, used more than $200 million of the funds for himself, buying yachts and fancy homes for a high-end timeshare venture that never took off. Then the Blixseths divorced; in June 2008, Blixseth’s ex-wife Edra received the Yellowstone Club as part of the couple’s divorce settlement, and CrossHarbor lent Edra $35 million in bridge loans to keep the club going. But it wasn’t enough. The club defaulted on the Credit Suisse loan and declared bankruptcy in November 2008. CrossHarbor, by then pretty familiar with the club’s finances, partnered with about 40 club members to buy Yellowstone Club out of bankruptcy for the bargain price of $115 million in 2009. (For more on the perks and some of the billionaire members of the Yellowstone Club, see here .) After CrossHarbor expanded its Big Sky footprint, Byrne took a close look at other resort towns and observed that growth in Jackson Hole, Wyoming took off after it added two high-end, branded hotels–a Four Seasons and the luxury Aman chain’s Amangani. As of 2013, Big Sky had a handful of hotels, but none were national brands. “Engineers and architects working here would still drive an hour back to Bozeman to get their Marriott points,” Byrne points out. Lone Mountain Land Company began developing The Wilson in the town center, a Marriott Residence Inn-managed property that was Big Sky’s first four-star hotel, which opened in 2019. In late 2021, after nearly a decade in the works and an investment of more than $700 million, Lone Mountain Land debuted the luxury Montage Big Sky hotel, an elegant development located within Spanish Peaks Mountain Club with ski access to Big Sky Resort. It caters to high-end fit and luxury travel groups, which help fill rooms during off-peak times. “The hotels here will stay 100% occupied from June 15th until the middle of September. But then in the shoulder seasons you need to backfill with groups ultimately to be successful running a five-star property–because it runs with a high expense load,” Byrne explains. Byrne still lives in the Boston area and makes it out to Big Sky multiple times a year. When Forbes visited in July, he was in town for the 15th anniversary of CrossHarbor buying the Yellowstone Club. An investor dinner that night celebrated their success. After riding an intense wave of growth during Covid–when Montana’s relatively lenient restrictions and easy access to the outdoors drew new residents to this corner of the state–Big Sky is experiencing a slowdown. Offers are still coming in for homes and condos, but Lone Mountain Land is adding enticements like furniture credits with a property purchase. “Right now is actually a very good time to buy property in Big Sky. You get deals from us that might not have been on the table and probably won't be on the table in the not-too-distant future,” says Kidd. One thing that Lone Mountain hasn’t done is cut prices. CrossHarbor Capital's Montana subsidiary, Lone Mountain Land Company, now owns more than half of Big Sky's town center—pictured here—and has developed some of it. Courtesy of Lone Mountain Land Company In contrast to the very pricey and highly exclusive Yellowstone Club (capped at 914 members, a $500,000 deposit and a minimum $10 million purchase of land or a home to join, plus $78,000 annual dues and $14,000 annual property owners association fees), buying into a place at Moonlight Basin and Spanish Peaks is relatively affordable. Residences at Moonlight Basin and Spanish Peaks start at $1.5 million for a studio–though they quickly escalate, with a 6-bedroom, 9,300 square foot home clocking in at $30 million. Membership fees for each of the clubs are $150,000 and $200,000, respectively, with annual dues of around $25,000, and include access to the clubhouse and club restaurants, unlimited golf and other outdoor activities. (There are also lower-priced memberships that exclude golf.) What has enabled CrossHarbor to survive–even thrive–in a location where several others ended up in bankruptcy? Too much debt plagued the prior owners of Yellowstone Club, Spanish Peaks and Moonlight Basin, says Kidd. “They were all different, but they all had way too much leverage. They need to be built with equity to withstand time and challenging economic environments. You shouldn't leverage land,” he explains. Lone Mountain Land does borrow money–but for construction loans, not for buying land, says Kidd. Picking up the Big Sky parcels for bargain prices certainly helped avoid the need to borrow. As with any resort town, there are plenty of challenges, the biggest one being the shortage of workforce housing. Lone Mountain Land says it has spent more than $200 million to build or acquire about 650 housing units for its workers in Big Sky and about 30 miles away in Gallatin Gateway. But 75% of the overall Big Sky workforce lives in the surrounding county areas and commutes in for their jobs. No matter what, Byrne and Kidd have plans to keep growing. One of their latest undertakings – about a decade in the works–is the One&Only Moonlight Basin hotel, located on a ridge inside the Moonlight Basin community with stunning views of Big Sky’s iconic Lone Peak. One&Only, an ultra-luxury hotel chain founded by the late South African entrepreneur Sol Kerzner, is now owned by the Investment Corporation of Dubai (the main investment arm of the Dubai government); Big Sky will be its first U.S. location. Lone Mountain Land, with Investment Corporation of Dubai as a minority partner, is spending $850 million on the project. The hotel’s ski lodge –which will connect to the Big Sky Resort via a newly-built gondola–is set to open in December, with the hotel to follow next year. Lone Mountain Land is also expanding further into Montana. In 2021, it bought the 18,000-acre Crazy Mountain Ranch about an hour and a half from Big Sky and created a separate club there, with fly fishing, horseback riding and a golf course under construction. Initial deposit to join: $1.5 million. Back in Big Sky they figure they’ll build another 200 to 400 homes each at Spanish Peaks and Moonlight Basin in the next 15 years. And they plan to add two more hotels, but have yet to disclose the details. “It was pretty clear to me that to fix Yellowstone Club, we’d have to make some community-based infrastructure investments that would make everything more valuable,” says Byrne. “We thought it would be best if we could control how that product was leaked out to the market and have a role in all those things. That’s why we acquired basically the balance of what’s going on in Big Sky.” Correction, October 14: Private equity firm Hillhouse, which owns part of CrossHarbor Capital, is headquartered in Singapore.

The bull market is 2 years old. Here's where Wall Street thinks stocks go next. Read full article Josh Schafer · Reporter Updated Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 9:47 AM 5 min read Link Copied 669 In this article: The bull market in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) began two years ago and is showing few signs of slowing. Backed by the rise of artificial intelligence euphoria and a surprisingly resilient US economy , the S&P 500 has gained more than 60% in the past two years and is hovering near an all-time high. Wall Street strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance believe the bull can keep running wild. Barring any unexpected shocks, the path higher appears to be clear, with earnings growth expected to keep accelerating and the economy on seemingly solid footing as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. A bull market for the S&P 500 was officially declared in June 2023 when the index rose 20% from its recent bear market low. History says this bull market still has legs. At two years, the bull market is well shy of the average run of 5.5 years. And the total return thus far, about 60%, is a far cry from the average 180% gain, per research from Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. In the past few weeks, several Wall Street equity strategists have made the case for the benchmark index to rise further into both year-end and into 2025, supported by accelerating earnings for the S&P 500. "We continue to be surprised by the strength of market gains and decided yet again that something more than an incremental adjustment was warranted," BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote in a September note when raising his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to a Street high of 6,100 from a previous target of 5,600. On Oct. 4, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target to 6,000 and initiated a 12-month target of 6,300. Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin did note, though, that already high valuations could limit the upside for how far the index can reach in 2025. Risks to the rally Strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance agreed with Kostin that already stretched valuations present a challenge to how much higher stocks can go. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon noted that dating back to the mid-1960s, the only time valuations have been this stretched on a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio were 2021 and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. "This would tell you that the bull is much older or somewhat near the end of this life," Gordon said. But strategists often warn that a high valuation itself isn't a proper tool for calling the end of a bull market. Stocks can trade at what are considered to be expensive valuations for longer than expected. What that does tell investors is that much of the good news that could push stocks higher might've already been priced in. Story continues "If you look at what the market's discounting right now, we'd say front and center, a big chunk of what's being priced in is a soft landing sentiment," Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. Charging Bull statue by Arturo Di Modica is seen in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York, on July 4, 2024. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images) Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz noted that high valuations themselves aren't why bull markets end. There needs to be a catalyst. He explained there are two common reasons market drawdowns happen: a spike in interest rates or a rise in the unemployment rate. With inflation well off the boil of 2022 and the recent increase in unemployment stalling out , neither of the two downside catalysts are clearly in view. There could, of course, be a surprise no one sees coming. But "it's a little bit harder to see where the shock comes from," Chronert said. "If things continue to play out incrementally, investors can handle a little bit of a change [to the economic narrative] here, a little bit of a change there ... It's when you get a more immediate unraveling, and it's hard to really say that immediate unraveling is going to come." This sets the market up for a narrative shift. To Kantrowitz, the currently expensive valuations show that the bull market is likely moving from a macro-driven environment, where factors like inflation falling and other signs of economic resilience have pushed stocks higher, to one that is more based on the fundamentals. "For this market to continue moving higher, and particularly to determine what stocks lead, it's going to be all about earnings," Kantrowitz said. The bar for earnings remains high. Consensus estimates project earnings to grow nearly 10% in 2024 and almost 15% in 2025. The key for investors remains finding which sectors are seeing earnings growth accelerate rather than just staying steady. And , according to Chronert, part of that story could come down to the two letters that defined the first part of the bull market : AI. Chronert, who said his team is still a holder of the "Magnificent Seven" tech cohort , doesn't doubt that the AI narrative will continue to manifest itself in the market. But after significant gains seen in those tech stocks over the past two years amid large earnings growth, focus may continue to shift to the broadening impact of AI on companies that aren't making the AI chips or the cloud servers operating the new technology. For AI to continue to have broader impact on the market and keep pushing earnings growth for the index above expectations, "you've got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins [and] profitability metrics," Chronert said. He added, "It would be that sort of thesis that has to play out, and that's going to take two to five years." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer .

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Macquarie Technology Group Limited (ASX:MAQ)? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 1:44 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Macquarie Technology Group (ASX:MAQ) has had a rough three months with its share price down 10%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Macquarie Technology Group's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Macquarie Technology Group How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Macquarie Technology Group is: 7.2% = AU$33m ÷ AU$455m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.07. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. Macquarie Technology Group's Earnings Growth And 7.2% ROE When you first look at it, Macquarie Technology Group's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 6.4%. Having said that, Macquarie Technology Group has shown a modest net income growth of 14% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Macquarie Technology Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Macquarie Technology Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is Macquarie Technology Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Macquarie Technology Group doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen. Summary In total, it does look like Macquarie Technology Group has some positive aspects to its business. That is, a decent growth in earnings backed by a high rate of reinvestment. However, we do feel that that earnings growth could have been higher if the business were to improve on the low ROE rate. Especially given how the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more. Have feedback on this article?

Bega Cheese Limited (ASX:BGA) Stock Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead ? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 11:51 PM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Bega Cheese (ASX:BGA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 23% over the last three months. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Bega Cheese's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Bega Cheese How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Bega Cheese is: 3.0% = AU$31m ÷ AU$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.03 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. A Side By Side comparison of Bega Cheese's Earnings Growth And 3.0% ROE It is quite clear that Bega Cheese's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 8.0%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 51% seen by Bega Cheese was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio. So, as a next step, we compared Bega Cheese's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 3.3% over the last few years. past-earnings-growth The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is BGA worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether BGA is currently mispriced by the market. Story continues Is Bega Cheese Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 36% (that is, a retention ratio of 64%), the fact that Bega Cheese's earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline. Moreover, Bega Cheese has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Bega Cheese's future ROE will rise to 7.6% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE. Conclusion Overall, we have mixed feelings about Bega Cheese. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Is Adairs Limited's (ASX:ADH) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 12:40 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Adairs (ASX:ADH) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 15% over the last month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Adairs' ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Adairs How Is ROE Calculated? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Adairs is: 14% = AU$31m ÷ AU$223m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.14 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Adairs' Earnings Growth And 14% ROE To begin with, Adairs seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 17%. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Adairs saw little to no growth in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures. We then compared Adairs' net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 15% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Adairs''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Adairs Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? With a high three-year median payout ratio of 64% (implying that the company keeps only 36% of its income) of its business to reinvest into its business), most of Adairs' profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the absence of growth in earnings. Moreover, Adairs has been paying dividends for nine years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 63%. Still, forecasts suggest that Adairs' future ROE will rise to 19% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much. Summary On the whole, we do feel that Adairs has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Is Nick Scali Limited's (ASX:NCK) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Oct 13, 2024, 1:38 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Nick Scali (ASX:NCK) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Nick Scali's ROE. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Nick Scali How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nick Scali is: 31% = AU$81m ÷ AU$258m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.31 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Nick Scali's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE To begin with, Nick Scali has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 17% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Nick Scali over the past five years. We then performed a comparison between Nick Scali's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 15% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Nick Scali's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Nick Scali Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Nick Scali has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 64%, meaning that it is left with only 36% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders. Besides, Nick Scali has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 67%. As a result, Nick Scali's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 31% for future ROE. Conclusion On the whole, we feel that Nick Scali's performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Vita Life Sciences Limited's (ASX:VLS) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 11:35 PM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Most readers would already know that Vita Life Sciences' (ASX:VLS) stock increased by 4.6% over the past month. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Vita Life Sciences' ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Vita Life Sciences How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vita Life Sciences is: 19% = AU$9.4m ÷ AU$49m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.19 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Vita Life Sciences' Earnings Growth And 19% ROE To start with, Vita Life Sciences' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Vita Life Sciences' decent 20% net income growth seen over the past five years. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Vita Life Sciences' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 35% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Vita Life Sciences is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Story continues Is Vita Life Sciences Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? With a three-year median payout ratio of 45% (implying that the company retains 55% of its profits), it seems that Vita Life Sciences is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered. Besides, Vita Life Sciences has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Summary Overall, we are quite pleased with Vita Life Sciences' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Not to forget, share price outcomes are also dependent on the potential risks a company may face. So it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved in the business. Our risks dashboard would have the 3 risks we have identified for Vita Life Sciences. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Duxton Water Limited (ASX:D2O) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Oct 13, 2024, 12:42 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: It is hard to get excited after looking at Duxton Water's (ASX:D2O) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.1% over the past week. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Duxton Water's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Duxton Water How Is ROE Calculated? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Duxton Water is: 5.9% = AU$12m ÷ AU$201m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.06 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. Duxton Water's Earnings Growth And 5.9% ROE At first glance, Duxton Water's ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 8.5% either. Although, we can see that Duxton Water saw a modest net income growth of 6.9% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. We then compared Duxton Water's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 5.6% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Duxton Water's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Duxton Water Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? Duxton Water has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 88%, meaning that it is left with only 12% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders. Moreover, Duxton Water is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of seven years of paying a dividend. Conclusion Overall, we feel that Duxton Water certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

Following Oct 12, 2024, 12:52pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The equity market continued on a roll this week with both the DJIA and the S&P 500 closing at new historic highs on Friday (October 11 th ). For the week, all four major indexes were up around the +1% level. Equity Markets Universal Value Advisors The so-called “Magnificent 7” had mixed results for the week with Nvidia the only real winner. Of the remaining six, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon were marginally higher, Meta and Google marginally lower, with Tesla the biggest loser (-12.9%). Magnificent 7 Universal Value Advisors The equity market seems to be momentum driven, as earnings forecasts have not risen, moving the market’s price/earnings ratios ever higher, now standing at nearly 28X; the historical normal is 16X-18X. Bonds, on the other hand, have seen rising yields in October, as market participants have priced out the “Recession” scenario. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen from its 3.62% low on September 16 th to 4.09% on Friday (October 11 th ). Historically, the rise in bond yields is, contrary to popular belief, not unusual after the Fed’s first rate cut, as markets believe that the Fed has acted in time to prevent Recession. Nevertheless, history also shows that a few months later, rates are significantly lower as the Fed moves the Fed Funds Rate to or through “neutral” (2.8% currently). MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best Tax Software Of 2022 Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022 Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes Employment and the Labor Market Financial markets were shocked by the September Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report (issued on October 4 th ). That report indicated that America’s economy created +245K jobs in September, making a mockery of the consensus estimate of +150K. In addition, job growth for the prior two months (July & August) was marked up by +72K. Almost universally, the report was hailed as “super strong,” and the odds of an economic slowdown were reduced to near zero, all based on this single report. Even subtracting out the Birth/Death model automatic add-in of 105K, the number actually counted, at 149K, was spot on to the 150K consensus view. The Birth-Death model is an uncounted “add-in” to the job numbers; it is a trendline estimate of jobs created by small businesses which are not surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This biases the data, especially at economic turning points. To this point, we note the reduction of more than -800K jobs in a recent BLS revision to the job numbers for the year ending in March. ADP, which produces its own job estimates each month and releases them just prior to the “official” BLS release, reported a +143K number, not much different than the +149K number cited above (ex-Birth/Death). The issue with ADP’s number is that its raw (not seasonally adjusted) number was -260K (the negative sign is not a typo). According to Rosenberg Research, the seasonal adjustment for ADP’s September payroll calculation was the most generous for any September back to 1939. As a result, it is our view that those payroll numbers will be revised down, and while the consensus is that the payroll numbers show a “strong” economy, we have reservations, as other closely watched indicators are not corroborating that story. The ISM Manufacturing Index, at 47.2 contracted in September for the sixth month in a row (50 is the demarcation line between expansion and contraction). This index has shown contraction in 22 of the past 23 months. From that, we conclude that manufacturing has been in a Recession for nearly two years. Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the outplacement employment firm, says that layoff announcements are up +53.5% over the past year. Outside of the Pandemic, such announcements are the highest since 2011. At the same time, the firm says that hiring announcement are down nearly -32% from a year ago with autos, construction, leisure/entertainment, industrial goods, tech, and retail announcing the sharpest pullbacks. Total Job Openings Universal Value Advisors The Conference Board’s September survey indicated that the “jobs are plentiful” question has been negative (under 50) for seven months in a row, while the “jobs hard to get” response was the highest since February 2021. In the latest (September) JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey), hiring fell -9.7%, job openings were down -14.1%, and voluntary quits (dark line, left axis) always a marker of the strength of the labor market, were down -14.2% (and by more than -50% since their 2022 peak). US JOLTS: Quits Rate Universal Value Advisors The chart also shows that on a year/year basis, the growth in compensation has been falling and has now approached 4%. Given the growth in productivity, compensation growth does not appear to be inflationary. The workweek shrank from 34.3 hours to 34.2, overtime hours were cut -3.3%, and those out of work for more than 27 weeks rose to 23.7% in September from 21.3% in August indicating that jobs are becoming harder to find. While Non-Farm Payrolls grew by +254K, the government sector (non-cyclical) grew a whopping +785K. According to Rosenberg Research, except for June 2020 (post-Pandemic), this is a record growth for government back to 1948. No doubt, hiring teachers for back-to-school played a significant role, but that should be taken into account in the seasonal adjustment process. So, given the +254K official Establishment Survey number (the Household Survey was +430K), private sector jobs decreased significantly; by -531K via the Establishment Survey and by -355K in the Household Survey. On a year/year basis, jobs in the private sector are down -463K. That a loss rate of -0.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, public sector employment is up +2.8% over that time period (+598K). A continuing contraction in manufacturing (a fall in production) and a decline in labor input (a fall in the hours worked in the workweek) are part of the employment data release that are important from an overall macroeconomic standpoint. Unfortunately, these have been moved to the shadows because the NFP number (+254K) has been billed by the media as “super-strong.” Inflation On Wednesday (October 10 th ), the September Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed up a little hotter than expected causing some consternation in the Bond market, with yields rising significantly off their September lows. 10 Year Treasury Yield Universal Value Advisors The headline number was up +0.2% for September, and the core (ex-food and energy) rose +0.3%. The consensus estimate was +0.1% and +0.2% respectively. That took the year/year headline reading down to 2.4% (Fed’s target is 2.0%) from 2.5% in August and the core to 3.3%. The year/year headline number was the lowest since February 2021. Further analysis shows that 75% of the move higher in the CPI came from a rise in food costs (+0.4%) and the cost of shelter (+0.2%) which offset the -1.9% fall in energy costs. In past blogs, we have noted that the BLS uses lagged data in its calculation of shelter costs. A truer picture of shelter costs can be seen in the charts below. MoM Change in National Rent Index (2019- Present) Universal Value Advisors The charts shows that shelter costs have been falling (-0.7% year/year), and that, because BLS uses shelter numbers that a lagged nearly a year, falling rents will soon begin showing up in the CPI. Then on Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) came in flat (0.0%) for September. Wall Street’s expectation was for a +0.1% reading, so the flat reading was a “beat” in Wall Street terms. The index now stands +1.8% higher than it was in September 2023, a year ago. The PPI is important because it measures prices early in the production process, and is a leading indicator of future movements in the prices of final goods and services. The Fed Given the gentle downward path of the annual inflation rate in both consumer and producer prices, and the fact that the payroll numbers were not as super strong as the media has portrayed, the question on the minds of Wall Street analysts is “What impact will these inflation numbers have on the Fed’s interest rate decisions at its upcoming November and December meetings?” The November Fed meeting dates are November 6-7 and December 17-18. For the November meeting, the Fed won’t have another CPI or PPI update since they aren’t due out until mid-month. By December’s meeting, since it occurs mid-month (December 17-18), they will have access to both the October and November CPI and PPI reports. While CPI and PPI are important inputs into Fed rate decisions, the Fed’s preferred measure for inflation is the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, and particularly core PCE (ex-food and energy). Those come out at month’s end. So, at the November meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will have seen the September PCE numbers and they will have access to October’s PCE results at their December meeting. Because we expect softer inflation numbers for the remainder of the year, we think those softer inflation numbers will counter the “super strong” Non-Farm Payroll numbers and expect -25 basis point reductions in the Fed Funds rate at both of the remaining 2024 meetings. Here is our logic: The Fed’s estimate of the “neutral” Fed Funds rate is now estimated to be about 2.8%. Any Fed Funds rate above that 2.8% neutral rate is considered “restrictive”; conversely, a Fed Funds rate below 2.8% is “accommodative.” Currently, the Fed Funds rate target is 4.75%-5.00%. In a “soft-landing” or “no-landing” economic scenario, the Fed will logically move rates toward that “neutral” 2.8% level. In a hard-landing (i.e., Recession), the Fed should logically be moving rates below “neutral.” Only in the case of a reacceleration of economic activity will the Fed not get to “neutral.” But even in this case, rates are likely to go lower from current levels. Evidence of an acceleration of economic activity is scarce. So, it is our view that the Fed will move rates down by at least 200 basis points (2 percentage points) to “neutral” in a soft-landing environment, and by more if a Recession develops. Final Thoughts Equity markets continue to move higher with the DJIA and S&P 500 closing at new historic highs on Friday (October 11 th ). A cautionary note here: the market’s P/E ratio is two standard deviations above its historic mean. Bond yields, on the other hand, have risen (prices falling) on the belief that the Fed has engineered a “soft” or “no” landing scenario. Historically, bond prices have generally had a momentary spike after the Fed’s first rate cut. But, after that momentary “tantrum,” history shows that those rates fall significantly, especially when the economy shows signs of slowing. The most recent payroll report has been labelled “extremely strong.” But, an in depth analysis reveals many cracks. The increase in employment was all from government employment; private sector jobs have shrunk. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, came in slightly hotter than Wall Street expected. The sister PPI was slightly cooler. As a result, unless there is dramatic evidence to the contrary, we expect the Fed to lower rates by 25 basis points at both its November and December meetings, and that by the end of next year, the Fed Funds rate will be at the “neutral” rate (near 3%) if there is a “soft-landing” or lower if a Recession appears.

KinderCare just became a public company. Can it fix the childcare shortage? Read full article Brooke DiPalma · Senior Reporter Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 2:00 PM 6 min read Link Copied 107 In this article: Early childhood education provider KinderCare ( KLC ) hit the public market on Wednesday. The IPO came at a timely moment as the high cost of childcare has gained attention ahead of the US election. KinderCare, the largest private provider of early childhood education, debuted under the ticker "KLC" on the New York Stock Exchange at $24 per share. The price was at the low end of the expected range of between $23 and $27 and valued the company at $2.75 billion. KinderCare stock climbed 16% in its first trading week to settle at $28 as of the close Friday. CEO Paul Thompson told Yahoo Finance that the company was "really pleased" with where it was at and said it was "focused on the long term," with growth ahead for the organization. Wednesday marked the second time the company sought to make a public debut; it had previously pulled back IPO plans in 2022. Following the IPO this week, the Swiss private equity firm Partners Group still maintained a controlling interest in the company, owning roughly 70%. KinderCare brought in $2.5 billion in revenue, $102.6 million in net income, and $266.4 million in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in fiscal year 2023. The company plans to use the proceeds to pay back debt. As of June 29, the company had $1.5 billion in outstanding debt, plus $104.2 million available for borrowing under its credit facilities and outstanding letters of credit of $55.8 million. "Most of [the IPO proceeds are] going to paying down debt," Thompson said. "That was an interest of ours to get our leverage where we wanted it to be in a public market." KinderCare Learning Center, TriBeCa, New York City, N.Y. (Plexi Images/GHI/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (UCG via Getty Images) Despite the favorable reaction in its first week as a public company, not all investors are sold on the stock. New Constructs founder and CEO David Trainer is skeptical about KinderCare, telling Yahoo Finance over the phone that investors should "wait it out at a minimum," but they "probably never want to be in this." "It appears to be quite unprofitable and very expensive stock as well," Trainer said, raising concerns over the amount of outstanding debt the company holds. "We're seeing a very highly indebted business ... It looks like a private equity bailout." The competitive landscape in childcare According to S&P Global Ratings senior analyst Carlee Martineau, all childcare providers have benefited from increased occupancy due to high demand for day care and backup care. KinderCare is the largest private childcare provider in the US, with 2,000 early childhood education centers that create the capacity to care for over 200,000 children. Thompson noted there's a "lot of opportunity" for KinderCare to serve more families beyond the 40 states and District of Columbia, where it operates today. Story continues However, the childcare company faces plenty of competition from local community organizations providing daycare and others in the public market. Michigan-based Learning Care Group is the second-largest provider, with a capacity of 160,000, per S&P Global Ratings. It is followed by Bright Horizons Family Solutions ( BFAM ), which has the capacity to serve approximately 115,000 children across 1,032 care centers. Childcare costs have soared in recent years. The cost of day care and preschool is up 6.2% year over year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index , and the Department of Labor recently estimated that childcare costs account for roughly 8% of the median family income. Yet, due to necessity, the demand in the US remains "supported by favorable economic and demographic trends, such as an increasing number of dual-earner households that require childcare services," an S&P Global Ratings note to clients said. S&P analysts added that there is an "increasing recognition of the importance of early education," yet there is a "substantial shortage of child care capacity." "Affordability is definitely a challenge because, with a good day care center, it could be $500 or so a week to send a kid there," UBS analyst Joshua Chan said. "It is a higher-ticket item, and so most day care chains likely gear toward the higher income demographics." Day care is 'bipartisan' The looming presidential election has drawn a spotlight on the industry and its vital role in the US economy. Several experts, analysts, and economists Yahoo Finance spoke to highlighted the ripple effect of a robust childcare network on employment and long-term household income. Childcare is the "backbone" of the economy, Wellesley Centers for Women senior research scientist Wendy Wagner Robeson said. "If we want our economy to grow and thrive, then you have to have childcare, because if you want men and women and people to work in your economy, you cannot leave those babies home alone." Children being cared for by teacher's aids at Sonshine Christian Academy in Drexel Hill, Pa., on Sept., 11, 2024. (RYAN COLLERD/AFP via Getty Images) (RYAN COLLERD via Getty Images) As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported , Vice President Kamala Harris outlined a plan to cap the cost of childcare at 7% of working families' incomes and proposed a new $6,000 tax credit for the first year of a child's life as part of her cost-of-living plan. Donald Trump is also considering an expansion of the child tax credit , according to sources, though details from his campaign remain scarce. During his time in office , Trump doubled the tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. Yet, KinderCare's Thompson said he isn't expecting the election to affect the business, as the day care industry is "bipartisan." If anything, large players like KinderCare are expected to benefit from the expiration of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, while smaller providers could face an even tougher challenge. S&P said it expects consolidation among childcare providers to increase over the next 12 months. "The COVID relief funding that has really helped the industry for the past couple years is rolling off," S&P's Martineau said. "We are expecting, in our base case, that there will be some strain for the smaller childcare operators and that these larger operators could potentially acquire additional childcare operators to help grow their base." "If you want a thriving economy, you need to have parents being able to go back to work. Parents need to know their child is in a safe and nurturing environment," he said. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Advertisement Investors are lingering in defensive trades that don't take advantage of the economy's strength, Morgan Stanley said, highlighting opportunities in underinvested sectors. The firm — which just last week upgraded cyclical stocks to "overweight" relative to defensives — described the financials group as particularly attractive. Morgan Stanley said net exposure to financials was in the bottom 15th percentile of a historical data series that goes back to 2010. And as the chart below shows, it's the most lightly owned of any sector. Morgan Stanley But Mike Wilson, the bank's chief investment officer and chief US equity strategist, sees a combination of headwinds that could lift financial stocks. Advertisement "In our view, this creates opportunity in [the financial] sector that we upgraded to overweight last week given: rebounding capital markets activity, a better loan growth environment in 2025, an acceleration in buybacks post Basel Endgame re-proposal, and attractive relative valuation," he wrote. Bank stocks also have had more attractive valuations since de-risking last month, after large-cap dealers signaled caution on their operating environment. Morgan Stanley noted that this weakness lowered earnings-season expectations for investors, making it easier for major lenders to outperform forecasts. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have jumped since publishing better-than-expected earnings reports last week: They're up by 3.8% and 8.8% since Friday's open. Despite this, Wilson found, the market's appetite for financials hasn't materialized. This isn't limited to bank stocks — investors are passing up on other cyclical sectors, concentrating exposure in defensive and quality names. Advertisement Utilities, healthcare, and real estate — which are defensive plays — are among the four sectors with high net exposure. Wilson argued that this shows that investors are still positioning themselves for a soft-growth scenario, which seems less likely in light of recent macroeconomic trends. Though Morgan Stanley moved to neutral on cyclicals versus defensives late last month, it upgraded cyclicals to overweight last week after September's jobs report surged past Wall Street forecasts . "As several key macro data points have come in better than expected (namely the jobs report and the ISM Services Index) following the Fed's 50bp rate cut, cyclicals have begun to show relative strength," Wilson said. Advertisement At the same time, rates-market yields are moving higher, indicating that growth concerns are falling. The note said cyclicals such as industrials, financials, and energy move up when yields rise, whereas defensive stocks are negatively correlated with higher rates.

Advertisement The accounting and consultancy giant EY has delayed the start of jobs for some of its new hires amid an industry slowdown. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that around 200 US recruits due to join EY-Parthenon, the firm's strategy division, in either November or January will now not begin work until mid-2024. EY confirmed the deferrals to Business Insider on Monday, saying in a statement the decision reflected "the current M&A environment and our business needs." "This will help ensure that our new joiners have the quality and breadth of assignments to ensure a successful start and strong professional trajectory," it added. Advertisement The firm has also reduced the number of internships available next summer and cut pay by roughly 2% for some of its US partners, the FT reported. EY-Parthenon Bosses explained the decision on an internal call, saying that the disappointing market for M&A deals and limited private equity activity had slowed advisory revenue growth more than expected since the start of the firm's fiscal year in July, the FT reported. Related stories EY said in its statement to Business Insider that the affected recruits would receive stipends to assist them in the interim period. A source told the FT that the stipends would be between $12,000 and $35,000. It's the second year running that the Big Four firm has delayed start dates for new hires. EY pushed back start dates twice in 2023 and also made at least 300 job cuts in its advisory wing. Advertisement But it is not alone in scaling back. Major competitors like Deloitte , PwC, and KPMG have also been struggling with slower demand for their consultancy services. M&A activity, a key source of demand for consultancies, has declined since 2022. The number of M&A transactions was down 25% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to PwC's report on Global M&A Industry trends . The downturn in demand has hit especially hard after many firms hired during the pandemic to handle growth as companies flocked to them for advice on navigating the pandemic. Now, without enough work to go around, they're shedding jobs. However, consulting firm bosses are optimistic about a rebound in the M&A market and the promise of returns on AI and future technologies. Advertisement Though transaction volumes were down globally, the value of M&A deals rose by 5% in the first half of 2024. That was largely driven by megadeal activity in the technology and energy sectors, according to PwC.

Advertisement This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Annie Cole, the 35-year-old founder of Money Essentials for Women in Vancouver, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity. In 2012, I got my first job out of college as a social worker , earning $26,000. After two years of emotionally hard work, I pivoted into education. I started working in a university's student academic resource center, helping first-year and at-risk students navigate the college experience. Two years later, I was promoted into an academic advising role. Next, I worked as a research coordinator until I finished my EdD program and got a research analyst job with a global ed-tech nonprofit. I loved and excelled at my work, and I received two executive promotions and several raises. Advertisement Still, this year felt like the perfect time to step away from my VP role and make two big moves: spend more time with my family and launch my own business. It was scary, but I knew I was ready. I moved into a part-time consulting role for my old company and went all-in on building out my financial coaching business, Money Essentials for Women . I've set myself up to retire at age 45 in 10 years, but transitioning from a $26,000 salary to an early retirement plan came in phases. Phase 1: Changing my money mindset When I was about to finish my EdD program, I started searching for jobs, and something clicked. I was only making $32,000. I opened up Indeed and set my filters for jobs that paid $40,000, which seemed like a reasonable salary increase. Advertisement Then I had this thought pop into my mind: What if you just went for something bigger? What about $60,000? I only applied for higher-paying jobs, and within a few months, I got a research analyst job with a $60,000 salary. I got nearly a $30,000 salary jump just because I changed my mind about my worth. Related stories Phase 2: Learning how to provide massive value Getting promoted isn't just handed to you — it's truly earned. Sometimes, I just wanted a clear job description, to show up to do that job, then go home and not think about work. I received my promotions because I didn't just show up and want to be told what to do. I showed up daily and asked myself, How can I help this company reach its biggest strategic goals quicker and more efficiently? How can I directly contribute to those goals every day? Advertisement It takes grit, forward-thinking, and hard work to help a new company grow, and I was up for the challenge. The more value I provided to the company, the more I was rewarded with promotions and raises. Phase 3: Investing I always invested in my retirement account, even when making $26,000. Once I started making more money, I became aggressive with my investment goals. I started reading personal finance books and following financial influencers online, and I slowly learned everything from how the stock market worked to different retirement and investment accounts. I invested in my traditional retirement account, a Roth IRA , and a brokerage account. I kept my budget as minimal as possible to focus on front-loading my investment accounts while I was young. Advertisement My husband and I also added our first real-estate investment in 2023, which simultaneously gives us rental income and home market value growth. Phase 4: Thinking beyond the 9-to-5 Trading my time for money is great, but it will always be limited. I'm setting up additional income sources to make money when I'm not actively working on them. I just launched a two-week online program for my financial coaching business that women can go through asynchronously. I also recently wrote an ebook I sell for $24.99 that captures all of my best tips in one place. This year, I'll make about $60,000 from real estate rental income, $130,000 from consulting and coaching work, and about $30,000 in investment account growth. Advertisement I have $345,000 invested right now I'll focus heavily on investing over the next 10 years (about $45,000 annually) and expect a 10% annual growth rate. When I turn 45, I'll have over $1.6 million. Using the 4% rule would give me just under $65,000 to live on annually when I retire, which is higher than my budget now. The above is based on my investment portfolio, which doesn't consider my real-estate investment property, the equity in my primary residence, and continued income from my business's online courses and books that will still pay me after I'm 45. Here's what I'm doing to ensure the plan works The traditional definition of retirement is when you quit working for good and live off your investments and savings. Most recently, though, the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has expanded this definition. Advertisement Now, you might "retire" from your full-time job in your 50s but keep a 10-hour-per-week job at Starbucks to supplement your income (this is called Barista FIRE, where you work part-time into retirement). I aim for a traditional retirement when I reach 45. I'm open to the possibility that I might want to keep running my own business by then. For me, it's all about having options. I do these three things consistently to make sure I stay on track: I use a personal financial tracker every single month to track my spending, income, and investments. I built my tracker years ago because I couldn't find one that met my needs online. I know exactly how much I need to save, spend, and invest to reach my goals, and I stay on track with my commitments. I used to think investing so much would feel depriving, but I don't miss that money. I fill my days with things that are fulfilling and free or low-cost. I'm not afraid to adjust as life happens. If a trip or a chance to throw a party for my best friend's engagement comes up, I will go for it. Life is too precious not to take advantage of those special moments. Advertisement You don't have to make a lot of money to invest enough to retire early Setting aside even the tiniest amount of money can seem like a waste of time when the alternative is to spend it now on a new shirt, better groceries, or toys for your kids. If you start making more money, it's just as hard. Lifestyle creep is real, and you'll probably find other things to spend your money on, no matter how much you make. The best way to invest more is to envision how that will benefit you and your loved ones. Every time I invest, I know I'm giving my future self a gift. I'm multiplying every single dollar I worked so hard to earn. Even in my 30s, I'm already reaping the rewards and seeing my account grow beyond six figures. Every investment is worth it, no matter how small. Advertisement Want to share your early retirement story? Email Lauryn Haas at lhaas@businessinsider.com.

How did speculation in companies that might exist nearly catch up to $1.1 trillion of private equity speculation in companies that do exist? And why did that torrent of money ruin so much? As we’ve previously discussed , wealth flocked to corporate equity to chase stories that could still come true - what poker players call outs . VC funds created even more outs, bundling otherwise unlikely startups and promising that only a few had to come true. Thanks for reading Cold Water! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe Massive unicorns were needed to carry all that deadweight, and it turns out that even fluffy and harmless things are absolutely terrifying if you make them big enough. It’s the Stay Puft Short Term Rental App Lighting the DoD’s R&D Budget on Fire… Three Times VC funds knew they were putting $300 billion a year into worthless companies at the bubble’s peak, because a typical fund looks like this: 🦄 10% of companies are home runs that provide nearly all the fund’s returns 😑 30% of companies pay for themselves, and maybe give some modest return 💩 60% of companies are complete failures that go to zero On top of this power distribution, funds had to get an absolutely massive pile of cash into play. They never know exactly who will win or lose, but they chased more and more marginal deal flow to get everything on the table. VC funds now needed to find a hundred unicorns per year to keep their aggregate returns above a Fidelity IRA. Follow the Unicorn Unicorn Hunting Off the top of your head, you can probably think of a few ways of making a billion dollar company. For example: A B2B SaaS Analytics company with $70 million in growing ARR. Doable with a decent product, a great inside sales team, and a few years to ramp up. A Government Contractor with $80 million in annual EBITDA. Doable with govie relationships across multiple programs, access to primes, and a decade or so to ramp up past performance. A war helps. A Social Network with 5 million daily users. Doable if you find the right niche, get some sticky viral growth going, and target countries with good GDP/capita. These aren’t that weird. But the funds need 100 winners, and they can’t all be B2B SaaS Analytics Platforms . Every VC company needs a path to a billion dollar valuation. Ideally multi-billion. So what does a billion dollar dog food company look like in real life? Sure, you have an Excel model… but what does it look like to feed a million dogs? Where are you going to get a half million pounds of meat every single day? What if you keep growing? Twenty more herds like this and you’ve got one day’s breakfast! Hundreds of Marshmallow Men Ghostbusters (1983) isn’t just a top five action-comedy; it’s a prescient look into the weirdness of a unicorn-dominated world. When the Ghostbusters were forced to choose the form of the Destroyer of New York, they tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something that could never destroy us. Oops. Ray : I tried to think of the most harmless thing… something that could never destroy us… Mr. Stay Puft. Venkman : Nice thinking, Ray Ray : We used to roast Stay Puft Marshmallows. By the fire. At Camp Waconda… Venkman : Ray has gone by-by Egon… what have you got left? Egon : Sorry Venkman, I’m terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought. Ray just needs some seed funding The Ghostbusters aren’t alone. Tony, Evan, Andy, and Stanley tried to think of the most harmless thing: a universal food delivery service, expanding the options from just Chinese food and pizza. Brian, Nathan, and Joe tried to think of the most harmless thing: people making extra money but renting out their spare room for the night. Travis and Garrett tried to think of the most harmless thing: people making extra money by giving people car rides. Mark tried to think of the most harmless thing: keeping track of your friends, and organizing group photos. With comments! Those were the innocuous founding ideas behind DoorDash, AirBnB, Uber, and Facebook. At scale, they would ruin communities, put restaurants out of business, destroy the dream of home ownership, and eventually undermine democracy itself. Your fries are soggy, your dasher hates you, the restaurant is going out of business, and DoorDash loses a billion dollars a year. Planning for Massive Success Now that they know those could do so much damage, founders looking for VC funding might think harder about their own ideas. What’s the society-destroying version of bringing back extinct species through gene editing ? Not the current business model, or the next one. The one at massive scale that makes them a unicorn. It’s probably not the problem we’re all thinking of . Uber and AirBnB grew almost in lock-step. Both sets of founders thought that they were on the road to improving society... based on their original idea. Both were unlocking stagnant supply, reducing waste and helping people make money. And they were right at first, as they helped users monetize extra beds and cars for extra cash. But there simply wasn’t enough extra stuff to hit the scale they needed. They tried encouraging some users users to buy more beds and cars to turn into full-time businesses. Then those users grew to be most of their users. Eventually, they induced so much demand for beds and cars amongst entrepreneurs that they made them less affordable for consumers. Photo by Max Böhme on Unsplash Each company is now valued around $100b. And rents in tourist areas have become unaffordable. Would their younger selves have gone down this path if they knew where it led? Maybe, maybe not. Breathing Room Maybe the VC funds themselves will consider whether they actually work at this scale. Too much wealth flowing into VC exploded assets under management, and caused inefficient investment (not your fund, of course, I mean the other ones). Unicorns had to chase society-bending hyper growth to drag the resulting deadweight ahead of the S&P 500, and that was before the half trillion dollars thrown in during 2021. The bump in interest rates has cooled things down. Funds, LPs, and founders have some breathing room to consider whether this all makes sense. Is there a billion-dollar version of every idea? Do they need to maximize AUM? Do most funds even beat the market? Maybe they’ll just put it all in bitcoin. Photo by Kristijan Arsov on Unsplash Thanks for reading Cold Water!

When you take assets that are underutilized by their owners, and shift to a rental model to allow more efficient utilization of said assets, you increase the value of those assets tremendously, and effectively increase collective wealth. To the extent it gets ugly, it's when you start maximizing how much value you extract out of the model. If you extract nearly all the value you've added, then the net benefit for everyone else is pretty minimal. This is where competition is supposed to step in to balance things out...

The Private Equity Firm Betting Big On Big Sky, Montana BETA THIS IS A BETA EXPERIENCE. OPT-OUT HERE Edit Story Forbes Billionaires Premium Editors' Pick The Private Equity Firm Betting Big On Big Sky, Montana Kerry A. Dolan Forbes Staff Kerry A. Dolan is a San Francisco-based editor covering billionaires. Following Oct 13, 2024, 06:30am EDT Updated Oct 14, 2024, 09:15pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Montage Big Sky hotel, opened in 2021 and owned by CrossHarbor Capital Partners' Montana arm. Courtesy of Lone Mountain Land Company Tucked behind one of the many doors to the main lodge at the exclusive Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Montana is a spacious lounge with comfy chairs, an array of snacks and cold drinks—and a 15 by 15 foot scale model of the club. It shows the club’s private ski mountain, its lush golf course and hundreds of numbered properties parceled throughout its 15,000 acres–all helpful in selling memberships. Sam Byrne, managing partner at Boston real estate investment firm CrossHarbor Capital, the club’s principal owner, proudly ticks through the amenities that his team has added to the uncrowded skiing and popular golf options at the club since purchasing it out of bankruptcy in 2009: a performance arts barn that hosts intimate concerts from global rock stars like Sting and the Doobie Brothers; high end restaurants like BaBa, run by Boston celebrity chef Ming Tsai; a night club; a fancy spa and more. “There’s nobody doing what we’re doing,” boasts Byrne. No other big ski resort town in the country has as dominant an investor as Big Sky does. In addition to buying the Yellowstone Club with partners 15 years ago for $115 million, CrossHarbor made two acquisitions in 2013, with the aim of developing more luxury homes in the area. It spent $26 million to buy Spanish Peaks Mountain Club, a ski and golf community on 5,700 acres that had also declared bankruptcy; and $32 million for Moonlight Basin, a ski resort and residential development that had also gone bankrupt and was owned by its creditor, Lehman Brothers Holdings. After the deals closed, CrossHarbor sold the ski terrains of both Spanish Peaks and Moonlight Basin to Boyne Resorts, the company that owns and operates the Big Sky ski mountain. It merged them into Big Sky Resort, turning it into one of the largest ski resorts in the country, with some 5,800 skiable acres. Altogether, CrossHarbor has spent at least $4 billion in Big Sky over the past 15 years via a mix of debt and equity. That includes acquiring 43,000 acres through the purchases of Yellowstone Club, Spanish Peaks, Moonlight Basin and land in the Big Sky’s town center, plus building homes, restaurants, two hotels and other amenities on them and buying and building workforce housing. After purchasing 500 acres from Bozeman’s Simkins family in 2022, CrossHarbor owns more than half of Big Sky’s town center, according to Matt Kidd, a CrossHarbor partner who runs the firm’s Montana subsidiary, Lone Mountain Land Company. That makes its Big Sky bets the biggest overall project for the 31-year-old firm, which has also invested nationwide in apartment complexes, office towers and retail centers. “CrossHarbor represents the [southwest Montana] region’s most significant private ownership and 75% of the local tax base,” the company said in its 2023 ESG report. CrossHarbor Capital's Matt Kidd (left) and Sam Byrne introduce the Doobie Brothers at a 2024 Labor Day weekend concert at the Yellowstone Club. Courtesy of the Yellowstone Club All this money has poured into a town of about 3,300 full time residents that is unincorporated–thus there is no mayor or city council. Most of Big Sky sits in Montana’s Gallatin County–except for the Yellowstone Club, which is part of neighboring Madison County. In addition to the Big Sky ski resort, Lone Mountain Land Company has the most at stake in the town–and has led Kidd, who lives full time in Big Sky with his wife and three children, to become something akin to the town’s unofficial mayor. “Their timing could not have been better. They’ve been riding a 15-year wave,” says Eric Ladd, who spent a decade on the sales and membership team at the Yellowstone Club before founding and chairing Outlaw Partners, a media, events and real estate firm in Big Sky in 2008. “We’ve had about 30 years of growth in less than a decade.” Byrne, 59, first got into real estate as a teenager, obtaining a license at age 17 to help sell homes at his mom’s real estate office near Marblehead, Massachusetts. He cofounded CrossHarbor Capital in Boston in 1993 to focus on commercial real estate private equity. It now has $10.2 billion in assets under management and additional offices in Chicago and Newport Beach, California. In 2020, CrossHarbor sold minority stakes in the firm to Dyal Capital Partners (now owned by Blue Owl), Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank of Japan and Singapore-headquartered private equity firm Hillhouse Capital. The firm’s investors include about 300 families or family offices, some of whom are Yellowstone Club members. CrossHarbor is somewhat cagey on its returns. Early backers in the Yellowstone Club have made about 4.5 times their invested capital. “Certainly the Yellowstone Club has been a financial success,” says Kidd, who joined CrossHarbor in 2008 specifically to work on the Yellowstone Club and has been running the firm’s Montana operations since then. As for the other Montana investments, he says “it should work out and our investors will be rewarded for their patience and their commitment.” CrossHarbor has also invested in apartment developments in places like Denver and Falls Church, Virginia; a 1-million-square-foot distribution center in Phoenix that’s leased to Amazon; and in open-air retail complexes in locations including Santa Rosa, California and Cranston, Rhode Island. The Yellowstone Club was founded by Tim Blixseth, an Oregon timber entrepreneur and former billionaire who bought 140,000 acres near Yellowstone National Park in 1991 and swapped them for the land to create the Yellowstone Club in 1999. Byrne, an avid skier, first visited a friend’s home at the club in the early 2000s, fell for the place and became a member in 2005. Two years later, CrossHarbor invested just under $55 million to buy a selection of lots at the club, and was in the process of buying the whole Yellowstone Club for an additional $455 million. That deal ended up falling apart. It later came to light that Blixseth, who had borrowed $375 million for the club from Credit Suisse, used more than $200 million of the funds for himself, buying yachts and fancy homes for a high-end timeshare venture that never took off. Then the Blixseths divorced; in June 2008, Blixseth’s ex-wife Edra received the Yellowstone Club as part of the couple’s divorce settlement, and CrossHarbor lent Edra $35 million in bridge loans to keep the club going. But it wasn’t enough. The club defaulted on the Credit Suisse loan and declared bankruptcy in November 2008. CrossHarbor, by then pretty familiar with the club’s finances, partnered with about 40 club members to buy Yellowstone Club out of bankruptcy for the bargain price of $115 million in 2009. (For more on the perks and some of the billionaire members of the Yellowstone Club, see here .) After CrossHarbor expanded its Big Sky footprint, Byrne took a close look at other resort towns and observed that growth in Jackson Hole, Wyoming took off after it added two high-end, branded hotels–a Four Seasons and the luxury Aman chain’s Amangani. As of 2013, Big Sky had a handful of hotels, but none were national brands. “Engineers and architects working here would still drive an hour back to Bozeman to get their Marriott points,” Byrne points out. Lone Mountain Land Company began developing The Wilson in the town center, a Marriott Residence Inn-managed property that was Big Sky’s first four-star hotel, which opened in 2019. In late 2021, after nearly a decade in the works and an investment of more than $700 million, Lone Mountain Land debuted the luxury Montage Big Sky hotel, an elegant development located within Spanish Peaks Mountain Club with ski access to Big Sky Resort. It caters to high-end fit and luxury travel groups, which help fill rooms during off-peak times. “The hotels here will stay 100% occupied from June 15th until the middle of September. But then in the shoulder seasons you need to backfill with groups ultimately to be successful running a five-star property–because it runs with a high expense load,” Byrne explains. Byrne still lives in the Boston area and makes it out to Big Sky multiple times a year. When Forbes visited in July, he was in town for the 15th anniversary of CrossHarbor buying the Yellowstone Club. An investor dinner that night celebrated their success. After riding an intense wave of growth during Covid–when Montana’s relatively lenient restrictions and easy access to the outdoors drew new residents to this corner of the state–Big Sky is experiencing a slowdown. Offers are still coming in for homes and condos, but Lone Mountain Land is adding enticements like furniture credits with a property purchase. “Right now is actually a very good time to buy property in Big Sky. You get deals from us that might not have been on the table and probably won't be on the table in the not-too-distant future,” says Kidd. One thing that Lone Mountain hasn’t done is cut prices. CrossHarbor Capital's Montana subsidiary, Lone Mountain Land Company, now owns more than half of Big Sky's town center—pictured here—and has developed some of it. Courtesy of Lone Mountain Land Company In contrast to the very pricey and highly exclusive Yellowstone Club (capped at 914 members, a $500,000 deposit and a minimum $10 million purchase of land or a home to join, plus $78,000 annual dues and $14,000 annual property owners association fees), buying into a place at Moonlight Basin and Spanish Peaks is relatively affordable. Residences at Moonlight Basin and Spanish Peaks start at $1.5 million for a studio–though they quickly escalate, with a 6-bedroom, 9,300 square foot home clocking in at $30 million. Membership fees for each of the clubs are $150,000 and $200,000, respectively, with annual dues of around $25,000, and include access to the clubhouse and club restaurants, unlimited golf and other outdoor activities. (There are also lower-priced memberships that exclude golf.) What has enabled CrossHarbor to survive–even thrive–in a location where several others ended up in bankruptcy? Too much debt plagued the prior owners of Yellowstone Club, Spanish Peaks and Moonlight Basin, says Kidd. “They were all different, but they all had way too much leverage. They need to be built with equity to withstand time and challenging economic environments. You shouldn't leverage land,” he explains. Lone Mountain Land does borrow money–but for construction loans, not for buying land, says Kidd. Picking up the Big Sky parcels for bargain prices certainly helped avoid the need to borrow. As with any resort town, there are plenty of challenges, the biggest one being the shortage of workforce housing. Lone Mountain Land says it has spent more than $200 million to build or acquire about 650 housing units for its workers in Big Sky and about 30 miles away in Gallatin Gateway. But 75% of the overall Big Sky workforce lives in the surrounding county areas and commutes in for their jobs. No matter what, Byrne and Kidd have plans to keep growing. One of their latest undertakings – about a decade in the works–is the One&Only Moonlight Basin hotel, located on a ridge inside the Moonlight Basin community with stunning views of Big Sky’s iconic Lone Peak. One&Only, an ultra-luxury hotel chain founded by the late South African entrepreneur Sol Kerzner, is now owned by the Investment Corporation of Dubai (the main investment arm of the Dubai government); Big Sky will be its first U.S. location. Lone Mountain Land, with Investment Corporation of Dubai as a minority partner, is spending $850 million on the project. The hotel’s ski lodge –which will connect to the Big Sky Resort via a newly-built gondola–is set to open in December, with the hotel to follow next year. Lone Mountain Land is also expanding further into Montana. In 2021, it bought the 18,000-acre Crazy Mountain Ranch about an hour and a half from Big Sky and created a separate club there, with fly fishing, horseback riding and a golf course under construction. Initial deposit to join: $1.5 million. Back in Big Sky they figure they’ll build another 200 to 400 homes each at Spanish Peaks and Moonlight Basin in the next 15 years. And they plan to add two more hotels, but have yet to disclose the details. “It was pretty clear to me that to fix Yellowstone Club, we’d have to make some community-based infrastructure investments that would make everything more valuable,” says Byrne. “We thought it would be best if we could control how that product was leaked out to the market and have a role in all those things. That’s why we acquired basically the balance of what’s going on in Big Sky.” Correction, October 14: Private equity firm Hillhouse, which owns part of CrossHarbor Capital, is headquartered in Singapore.

Financial Times has reported a potential joint bid by private equity groups TPG and Blackstone . Adding that the potential bid to consider the company’s enterprise value of $11.2bn, including debt. Bausch + Lomb was formed into an independent, publicly traded company as a spinoff from Bausch Health Companies , with the plans being first announced in 2020, with the Bausch + Lomb starting trading in May of 2022. Bausch Health owns a majority (88%) stake in Bausch + Lomb, and has faced significant backlash for the spin-off. A class action lawsuit against Bausch Health alleges that the company made “false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose” significant facts about the Bausch + Lomb spin-off. Specifically, the spinoff would not result in two strong separate companies and that without Bausch + Lomb, Bausch Health was left overly leveraged.

The lawsuit also goes on to allege that “the spinoff was not intended to benefit Bausch Health shareholders but instead designed to subvert the securities fraud litigation plaintiffs’ lawsuit against Bausch Health”.

Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 clinch fresh highs as Nvidia surges to record Read full article Karen Friar , Ines Ferré and Josh Schafer Updated Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 9:49 PM Link Copied 514 In this article: US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia ( NVDA ) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML ( ASML ), Arm Holdings ( ARM ), and Applied Materials ( AMAT ). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old . The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs ( GS ), Citi ( C ), and Bank of America ( BAC ) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 15 updates Mon, October 14, 2024 at 9:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Nvidia closes at an all-time high Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia , as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 8:46 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Fed's Waller wants to apply more 'caution' when cutting rates Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 8:15 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Why the Fed's rate cut isn't stopping inflows to cash on the sidelines The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past , noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Mon, October 14, 2024 at 7:30 PM GMT+1 Alexandra Canal China growth forecast boosted at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite ( 000888.SS ), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 ( 000300.SS ) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows . The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 6:46 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Bitcoin rally pulls crypto-related stocks higher Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase ( COIN ) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Source: Yahoo Finance Mon, October 14, 2024 at 6:00 PM GMT+1 Alexandra Canal DJT stock is on a tear. Again. Trump Media & Technology Group stock ( DJT ) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket , PredictIt , and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 5:15 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Fed’s Kashkari said 'modest' rate cuts are 'likely' in the coming quarters Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 4:36 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Dow, S&P 500 hold near record as tech, utilities leads rally Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^ IXIC ) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. Utilities and Technology gained on Monday Mon, October 14, 2024 at 4:33 PM GMT+1 Laura Bratton SoFi stock soars on $2 billion Fortress deal to expand loan platform SoFi Technologies ( SOFI ) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement . Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 3:36 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Dow climbs into green territory, holds near record The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 3:13 PM GMT+1 Laura Bratton TSMC stock hits record high, rejoins $1 trillion club Nvidia ( NVDA ) supplier TSMC ( TSM ) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 3:00 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Boeing slips more than 2% as plane maker plans cuts 10% of workforce, strike enters 5th week, Boeing ( BA ) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Mon, October 14, 2024 at 2:46 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Nvidia climbs 2%, hovers near record Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. Mon, October 14,

Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Propel Funeral Partners Limited (ASX:PFP) Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 1:45 AM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Propel Funeral Partners fair value estimate is AU$6.09 Current share price of AU$5.70 suggests Propel Funeral Partners is potentially trading close to its fair value The AU$6.03 analyst price target for PFP is comparable to our estimate of fair value. Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Propel Funeral Partners Limited ( ASX:PFP ) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model . View our latest analysis for Propel Funeral Partners Crunching The Numbers We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (A$, Millions) AU$21.5m AU$28.0m AU$30.7m AU$33.0m AU$34.8m AU$36.3m AU$37.7m AU$39.0m AU$40.2m AU$41.4m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.33% Est @ 4.45% Est @ 3.84% Est @ 3.41% Est @ 3.11% Est @ 2.90% Present Value (A$, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% AU$20.3 AU$24.8 AU$25.6 AU$25.9 AU$25.7 AU$25.2 AU$24.6 AU$24.0 AU$23.3 AU$22.5 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = AU$242m After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$41m× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.4%) = AU$1.1b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = AU$1.1b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%) 10 = AU$599m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$840m. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$5.7, the company appears about fair value at a 6.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf The Assumptions The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Propel Funeral Partners as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.935. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Propel Funeral Partners Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Services market. Shareholders have been diluted in the past year. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Australian market. Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Threat Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows. Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Moving On: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Is Adairs Limited's (ASX:ADH) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 12:40 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Adairs (ASX:ADH) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 15% over the last month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Adairs' ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Adairs How Is ROE Calculated? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Adairs is: 14% = AU$31m ÷ AU$223m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.14 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. Adairs' Earnings Growth And 14% ROE To begin with, Adairs seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 17%. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Adairs saw little to no growth in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures. We then compared Adairs' net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 15% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Adairs''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Adairs Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits? With a high three-year median payout ratio of 64% (implying that the company keeps only 36% of its income) of its business to reinvest into its business), most of Adairs' profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the absence of growth in earnings. Moreover, Adairs has been paying dividends for nine years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 63%. Still, forecasts suggest that Adairs' future ROE will rise to 19% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much. Summary On the whole, we do feel that Adairs has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Is Nick Scali Limited's (ASX:NCK) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sun, Oct 13, 2024, 1:38 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: Nick Scali (ASX:NCK) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Nick Scali's ROE. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Nick Scali How To Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nick Scali is: 31% = AU$81m ÷ AU$258m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.31 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Nick Scali's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE To begin with, Nick Scali has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 17% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Nick Scali over the past five years. We then performed a comparison between Nick Scali's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 15% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Nick Scali's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio , as compared to its industry. Story continues Is Nick Scali Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Nick Scali has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 64%, meaning that it is left with only 36% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders. Besides, Nick Scali has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 67%. As a result, Nick Scali's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 31% for future ROE. Conclusion On the whole, we feel that Nick Scali's performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Advertisement Investors are lingering in defensive trades that don't take advantage of the economy's strength, Morgan Stanley said, highlighting opportunities in underinvested sectors. The firm — which just last week upgraded cyclical stocks to "overweight" relative to defensives — described the financials group as particularly attractive. Morgan Stanley said net exposure to financials was in the bottom 15th percentile of a historical data series that goes back to 2010. And as the chart below shows, it's the most lightly owned of any sector. Morgan Stanley But Mike Wilson, the bank's chief investment officer and chief US equity strategist, sees a combination of headwinds that could lift financial stocks. Advertisement "In our view, this creates opportunity in [the financial] sector that we upgraded to overweight last week given: rebounding capital markets activity, a better loan growth environment in 2025, an acceleration in buybacks post Basel Endgame re-proposal, and attractive relative valuation," he wrote. Bank stocks also have had more attractive valuations since de-risking last month, after large-cap dealers signaled caution on their operating environment. Morgan Stanley noted that this weakness lowered earnings-season expectations for investors, making it easier for major lenders to outperform forecasts. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have jumped since publishing better-than-expected earnings reports last week: They're up by 3.8% and 8.8% since Friday's open. Despite this, Wilson found, the market's appetite for financials hasn't materialized. This isn't limited to bank stocks — investors are passing up on other cyclical sectors, concentrating exposure in defensive and quality names. Advertisement Utilities, healthcare, and real estate — which are defensive plays — are among the four sectors with high net exposure. Wilson argued that this shows that investors are still positioning themselves for a soft-growth scenario, which seems less likely in light of recent macroeconomic trends. Though Morgan Stanley moved to neutral on cyclicals versus defensives late last month, it upgraded cyclicals to overweight last week after September's jobs report surged past Wall Street forecasts . "As several key macro data points have come in better than expected (namely the jobs report and the ISM Services Index) following the Fed's 50bp rate cut, cyclicals have begun to show relative strength," Wilson said. Advertisement At the same time, rates-market yields are moving higher, indicating that growth concerns are falling. The note said cyclicals such as industrials, financials, and energy move up when yields rise, whereas defensive stocks are negatively correlated with higher rates.

The results beat analysts' expectations and set the stage for Goldman's executives to discuss why Wall Street may be at the cusp of a surge in corporate dealmaking activity . They cited lower interest rates, a strong economy, and higher demand for corporate financing. "We see significant pent-up demand from our clients," CEO David Solomon said in a call to discuss earnings. "The beginning of the rate-cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity." Advertisement Solomon said the M&A market still has a long way to go to reach historical 10-year averages. But he suggested there are reasons to be hopeful in a call that had one stock analyst asking about the potential for an "M&A supercycle." (Solomon didn't dismiss the idea, saying that 10-year averages could theoretically go up if much of the pent-up demand is released all at once.) It's not just M&A that's seeing signs of a comeback. Lower rates could also boost demand for corporate lending, IPOs , stock issuance, and more. Here are five key takeaways from the company's third-quarter earnings call. Advertisement Investment banking revenues are up Investment banking revenues over the last 9 months Screenshot Investment-banking revenues grew 20% over last year to $1.86 billion. But as the above slide shows, this wasn't a quarterly blip. Fees earned from M&A advice and debt and stock underwriting are up 24% this year versus the first nine months of 2023, including a 41% surge in debt underwriting. Goldman CFO Denis Coleman said equity-capital-markets activity, such as public stock issuances, "are still well below long-term averages." But in the last nine months, activity has surged 31%. Solomon, meanwhile, said it's only a matter of time before financial sponsors, a fancy term for private-equity firms , start transacting again. Sponsors have been "slower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity," Solomon explained. "Some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we have highlighted. And I do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next six, 12, 24 months." Advertisement Equity trading revenues surged A bar chart showing Goldman's investment banking and trading revenues Screenshot Revenues from trading, another key segment of the global banking and markets division, were also up. The firm reported $3.5 billion in equities trading revenue, up 18% over last year. That was offset by declines in the firm's fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading, which declined 12% to just under $3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, however, Goldman's FICC trading operation is up 4% versus last year, thanks in part to a 32% gain in revenues tied to the financing of FICC trades. (See the prior slide for more info.) Goldman's equities trading division is up 12% for the year. Volatility in the markets has created anxiety for traders, Solomon said. "This is an environment that is filled with uncertainty," he said, creating a need for clients to "constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping." Advertisement Demand for loans will only grow as interest rates decline Goldman's 3Q lending broken down by segment Screenshot While lending remains muted, Solomon highlighted several areas of potential growth as interest rates decline, including loans to high-net-worth individuals and more direct lending to corporations. The bank, Solomon said, has made a "strategic decision" to invest in lending for "ultra-high-net-worth" clients, adding that he sees plenty of room for growth . "While we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like JPMorgan and I would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability." Goldman also sees growing opportunities in corporate lending. The bank has long been a lender of leveraged loans and high-yield debt. But as interest rates start to cool, Goldman executives said they see more room to grow the bank's direct and private-lending books. Solomon said the firm is unique in its ability to syndicate, underwrite, and distribute loans. "We have an ability to direct lend. We have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs," he said. "The needs might be different in different transactional situations. So we like our positioning there." Advertisement Goldman continues to attract investments in its assets and wealth management business Assets under supervision hit a record $3.1 trillion Screenshot Goldman's commitment to growing its asset-and-wealth-management business also appears to be paying off as investors seek help managing a difficult market environment. Goldman's assets under supervision swelled to a record $3 trillion in the third quarter, thanks to net inflows of $66 billion. Some of that — $17 billion — came from an increase in assets through wealth management, wherein Goldman manages the portfolios of high-net-worth clients. Accounting for that growth, all in all, the bank reached total clients assets in wealth management of $1.6 trillion. Another $13 billion was sourced through the firm's institutional client channels. Goldman reorganized its asset-and-wealth-management unit two years ago, and it now encompasses products ranging from administering wealthy clients' portfolios to private credit and equity capital to managing assets for large financial institutions, like pensions. In recent years, Goldman leaders have made clear the importance of expanding the bank's footprint in this area. Solomon last year called it "the real story of opportunity for growth for us in the coming years" in a 2023 interview with CNBC , detailing the bank's strategy after its retreat from consumer banking. The increase in wealth-management assets is driving a need for additional staffing, the bank said. Goldman "continued to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading lending offerings to clients," Solomon said. Advertisement The consumer-banking retreat continues Consumer lending is waning Screenshot Meanwhile, the firm continues to withdraw from consumer banking . That function is housed in its platform-solutions division but was formerly combined with wealth management until the bank's 2022 reorganization. Solomon called it a "narrowing" of Goldman's "consumer footprint." The goal, the executives said, was to draw down the consumer activities the bank was heavily invested in a few years ago to the point that their impact becomes "negligible."

Subscribe: Apple Podcasts Spotify RSS All episodes All episodes Details Transcript October 15, 2024 Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm founded in 1972, grew to become one of the most storied venture capital firms in the world. The firm’s investment track record includes the names of some of the largest global companies. But the venture capital industry began facing new challenges in 2022, and investors were increasingly cautious. At that time Sequoia also began restructuring the firm and made other changes to their core identity. What would all of this mean for the future of Sequoia, and would the firm still be able to maintain their historical dominance? Harvard Business School senior lecturers Jo Tango and Christina Wallace discuss their case, “ Sequoia Capital .” BRIAN KENNY: In her 2013 blog post titled, “Welcome to the Unicorn Club,” venture capitalist, Aileen Lee, coined a term that has come to define the benchmark for investors the world over. Unicorns, that is privately held startups that are valued at $1 billion or more, are more common today than they were in 2013 when there were just 39 firms that met that definition. Today, the number is closer to fourteen-hundred and competition among the relatively small number of VC firms to find the next unicorn is fierce. For those who are keeping score, Sequoia Capital with 133 unicorns to its credit, sits squarely in the upper echelon. The firms it has invested in have come to represent more than 25% of the Nasdaq, or $1.4 trillion dollars in value. But on a business premised on venture, there are no sure bets and even survival isn’t guaranteed. Today on Cold Call , we welcome co-authors, Jo Tango and Christina Wallace, to discuss the case, “ Sequoia Capital .” I’m your host, Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network. Jo Tango is a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, where he teaches a course on venture capital and private equity, and also exited three unicorn companies. Welcome, Jo. JO TANGO: Thanks for having me. BRIAN KENNY: Great to have you back on the show. Christina Wallace is also a senior lecturer who teaches a course on launching tech ventures, and she is the author of a book called, The Portfolio Life . Welcome back, Christina. CHRISTINA WALLACE: Happy to be here. BRIAN KENNY: So, this will be fun. I found this case to be very interesting. And one thing about HBS is we have deep roots in the VC world. It’s something that the school is proud of. It’s part of our heritage. And so, I think it’ll be interesting for people to hear about sort of the VC world, the culture, and Sequoia’s place in it. I really enjoyed the case, so thank you for writing it. I know you have a couple of other authors. Do you want to mention the other authors on the case? JO TANGO: Yes, we have two other colleagues, Sri and Johnson, who helped us with this and we’re grateful for them. BRIAN KENNY: We can’t fit four guests in the studio, so that’s why we settled with the two of you, which is great. Jo, I’m going to ask you to start by telling us what the central issue is in the case and what your cold call is when you start the discussion in the classroom. JO TANGO: Yes, it’s the summer of 2023. The new managing partner of Sequoia is going around meeting their investors around the world, supposedly 50 of them, to try to explain to them the changes that have happened. Partners have left. They slashed the size of their crypto fund. And their China-India operations have been spun off. So, I would open the case by asking students, “Sequoia: is this a change or a decline?” And start that way. BRIAN KENNY: Christina, let me turn to you for a second. Why did you all decide to write this case? Why was it important? CHRISTINA WALLACE: I think anyone who’s been paying attention to the venture capital world in the last few years has noted the roller coaster that has been VC. We go from a boom cycle, where valuations are insane and there’s money to flow everywhere, to very quickly that money drying up and people getting a little bit more tight-fisted. And Sequoia, obviously one of the behemoths in this industry, so everyone is keeping an eye on what Sequoia is doing. And out of that, as Jo has mentioned, some pretty significant changes. Everything from sort of retrenching from this global firm footprint to backing away from crypto and watching to see what they’re going to do in AI. These trends that they had really leaned into quickly. So, I think it’s something very timely. It’s something very interesting as we’re looking at the industry as a whole and a leader within it. And honestly, any chance I have to work with Jo, I say yes. BRIAN KENNY: There you go. The world is so different today than when Sequoia first started, and we teased that a little bit in the intro. But basically, at that time there were many fewer players in the VC space. There were far fewer firms who would meet that definition. But things have really changed since then. So, Jo, maybe you can give us a little bit of background for people who aren’t as familiar with Sequoia Capital. And the protagonist in this case is Don Valentine. What was his vision for success for the company? JO TANGO: So, it’s interesting you say that, because Don Valentine was known for a person who fostered deep inquiry and total bluntness. It might be apocryphal, but supposedly there was a sign in his office that said, “Who cares?” And apparently, when he sat in on pitches by entrepreneurs, he would often interrupt and say, “Who cares?” And he was very good at focusing the partnership and focusing entrepreneurs on what they would need to do to be successful. Or to use some HBS language, he was the king of high standards. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. So, let me switch back to you, Christina. So, the first home run, I guess, that they had was Atari. And for people who don’t know what Atari is, because this goes way back, maybe you can describe that and talk about how that sort of set the stage for their future success. CHRISTINA WALLACE: Atari is the OG video game company, right? Anyone who grew up loving gaming first learned the company named Atari. And I think what’s so notable here is Don Valentine, he was a working class guy. He grew up, his father was a truck driver, his mom was a homemaker. He got a degree in chemistry, went off to the Navy, and then kind of made his way. And has a working history in the go-to-market side of a firm. He’s not a technologist by training, which a lot of the early venture capital partners are. So, what’s so interesting is he makes this first home run in Atari and a few more kind of tech firms behind that. It sort of sets the stage to say, “Okay, I know what I’m talking about. I’ve got good taste. I can vet the tech.” But very specifically, he and Sequoia are known for caring about the market and the go-to market as much as the technology, as much as the entrepreneur. And I think that speaks to one of the reasons why they’ve probably been so successful, that they’re very attuned to, “What is the customer need? Will this be pulled out of the companies that we’re investing in? Or are they going out and trying to make fetch happen?” BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, what are some of the other big names that they invested in early on? CHRISTINA WALLACE: Everything from eBay and PayPal to… JO TANGO: Apple. Yahoo. BRIAN KENNY: I’ve heard of those. JO TANGO: Airbnb. Google. CHRISTINA WALLACE: All of them. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. JO TANGO: FTX. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Oh, yeah. We’ll talk about that a little bit later, I think. Maybe not in any great detail. So, Jo, what are some of the things that they look at when they’re evaluating potential companies to invest in? JO TANGO: Yeah, to Christina’s point, they look at the market. So, if you think about how VCs pick deals or projects, do they pick the jockey? The founder? Do they lean on the horse, the product, or do they emphasize the racetrack? Which is the market. Don Valentine was known from very early on saying, “It’s all about the market. I can’t improve a bad market. I cannot create a market from scratch. But if I have a great market, I can find the right horse and the right jockey.” So, they always have been very focused on market spaces. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, Christina, is that different or like what other firms do? CHRISTINA WALLACE: It certainly stands out as somewhat of a unique proposition. I think there are a lot of VCs that say, “We are looking at founders first.” Where the founder, the founder, the founder is the talent, and, like, “I don’t really care what they’re building, find me the right founder, and we’ll back them, and we’ll see where they go.” And so, there are others that follow the technology trends and they’re like, “We are only investing in AI. We’re only investing in these spaces, and let’s find the right opportunities in that space.” And I think it’s a really interesting kind of industry agnostic perspective to say, “I want a market that is growing, that it has experiencing a major need,” and that there is an opportunity to exploit. In maybe a slightly less worrisome definition of that word. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, I know what you mean. So, this is a two-person dance, right? CHRISTINA WALLACE: Yeah. BRIAN KENNY: So, you’ve got Sequoia on the one hand, who may be looking at markets and potential players within those markets. What about the firms themselves? What do they need to be thinking about when they’re entertaining partnering with a firm like Sequoia? JO TANGO: Well, we actually quote an entrepreneur in the case who said that, “The final pitch meeting at Sequoia was the most intense hour of my life.” And as is also documented in the case, they’re looking for people who are underdogs, who are fearless, and who engage in what Sequoia calls “black and white thinking.” In the sense that people who are thinking in the gray matter and the gray zones all the time are going to lose time. Sequoia seems to want entrepreneurs who can make decisions quickly, maybe fail fast, but then get to the right answer. There’s a certain intensity to the firm that is pretty well-known in the industry. CHRISTINA WALLACE: And I think the firm reflects that. They’re sort of giving off the same vibes that they’re looking for from the founders. We have stories of them wiring millions of dollars to founders literally before the documents are even signed. Where once they make a decision, they move fast. They’re going straight to the deal and saying, “Let’s get this done.” And I think they’re looking for founders who respect that, and see the opportunity to partner with that kind of a thought partner in building these companies. BRIAN KENNY: Well, if you look at the companies that you rattled off before, that they’ve invested in some of those unicorns, the leadership of those companies are known as hard drivers. People who are action-oriented, who are doing anything that they can to make the firm successful. So, that sounds like a successful partnership there. CHRISTINA WALLACE: Yeah, for the most part it’s great, until it’s not. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. CHRISTINA WALLACE: I think the flip side of that coin is simply that is a very specific way of seeing the world, of looking at opportunity. And when you have both sides of the partnership with that very specific viewpoint, you are by definition, going to have some blind spots. You’re going to have things that you’re both missing. And I think that that comes out when we look at some of these deals like FTX and others, where you sort of look at that from afar and say, “What are they thinking?” BRIAN KENNY: Well, so let’s talk a little bit about that. What drove the teams, maybe it was Don’s decision, maybe it was a collective decision, to make some of these decisions that they did about expanding into global markets and about expanding into categories that may or may not have been proven to be successful? JO TANGO: Well, I think this is the dynamic within a venture firm. If you’re successful, you’ll be tempted to create more success. And expansion can happen one of two ways, you offer a new product. So, do you go from early stage to later stage? What Sequoia has done. Or do you offer a new geographic product to your investors? U.S. only to China, India, and Israel? So, the playbook works, as Christina says, until it doesn’t. And there’s been a long history of firms in the U.S.—Benchmark for example started a European office. It didn’t work out. They spun it off, it became Balderton, which is very successful. So, what we see in business is that sometimes the playbook that gives you success today isn’t the one that will give you success tomorrow. And one of the meta points of the case is this: over time every empire ends, every country falls, and every company fails. And Sequoia is an example, perhaps, of this bigger trend in business, which is, are they on the verge of failing? If so, why? If not, why? And the bigger managerial question really is, as a leader, and we’re in the business of educating leaders who make a difference, is how do you know when you’re at the inflection point and can you peer around corners, given this challenge of sustaining excellence? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and how does your culture help or hinder that process? We talked a little bit about the bluntness of the culture, but there’s also mentions in the case about collaboration and the way that they work together. I’m wondering, where does the culture help and where does it hurt? CHRISTINA WALLACE: Yeah, I think one of the really notable things about their culture is this teamwork. They have this history of saying, “I don’t care if it’s not your portfolio company, if you can help, step up. I don’t care if you’re not on the board, if you’ve got an idea or a relationship, or if you’re the better partner to take this deal, I’m going to hand it off, because we’re all economically benefiting from us being one

Toho Animation Acquires Gkids and Aims to Bring More Japanese Media to the U.S. Skip to content By Isaiah Colbert Published October 15, 2024 | Comments ( 0 ) | ð Copied! The Boy and the Heron. Â© Studio Ghibli In the latest news of surprise business acquisitions and mergers that make sense at first glance, Toho Animation, the self-proclaimed leader in Japanese entertainment, has announced its acquisition of Gkids , a North American animation producer and distributor. Earlier today, Gkids published a press release Â describing its acquisition by the Los Angeles-based Toho as one where Toho would acquire 100% equity from Gkids. At the same time, the other would maintain its independence (and folks in power as CEOs and whatnot) while utilizing Toho’s connections to bolster its commerce and further its reach in the entertainment world. What does all that mean to the average fan of Japanese entertainment and anime? Two mega powers in the industry are combining forces to compete against other companies that are jockeying for our precious attention, such as Disney. A key motivator behind Toho and Gkids’ partnership is the winning success both companies experienced at the box office this past year with Godzilla Minus One and Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron . As Gkids states in its press release, both films earned significant achievements within a week of each other, with the former earning the highest box office revenue for a Japanese live-action film in the states and the third largest-grossing foreign film in U.S. history, and the latter becoming Studio Ghibli’s highest-grossing film in the U.S. And even beyond that, the two aren’t strangers to one another, having collaborated with the theatrical releases of animated films like Spirited Away: Live on Stage , Makoto Shinkai’s Weathering With You , and animation Studio Trigger’s Promare . Reading between Gkids’ press release lines, the two likely decided to perform a fusion dance of sorts after making their presences felt during the most recent awards season (including the Oscars) . To put one’s capitalistic cap on, the two aim to have their combined forces lead to a repeat of their individual successes with the aforementioned award-winning films as a united front. “Gkids will continue to operate as we always haveâwith the same team, the same passion, and the same missionâbut now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company,” Gkids founder Eric Beckman and president David Jesteadt wrote in a joint statement. “This partnership will empower us to bring even more amazing films to North American and global audiences, while we continue to champion animation as a cinematic artform and push the limits of what the medium is capable of. We could not be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. The best is yet to come.” Godzilla Minus One . Image: Toho While Toho has become a household name for many an anime fan thanks to big marquee shonen series like Dragon Ball Z and Jujutsu Kaisen , Gkids has become a bit of a rising star in the cultural zeitgeist. Its North American theatrical distribution and home video releases of Look Back , Dan Da Dan , The First Slam Dunk , and Arcane season one are the most recent money-move examples of Gkids putting itself on the map for fans of Japanese entertainment and animation. Likewise, Toho has been on a future-sighted acquisition spree, recently taking on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off , Dan Da Dan , and Devilman Crybaby animation studio Science Saru. “Through their hard work, vision, and integrity, Gkids has built a unique position in the U.S. market, which dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission,” Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka wrote in the press release. “This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.” Hopefully, this no-brainer acquisition doesn’t lead to an influx of layoffs across Toho or Gkids, as we’ve seen countless times in the video game industry. In the meantime, the likes of Disney and Netflix can look forward to steep competition at both the box office and during awards season. Want more io9 news?

Advertisement The accounting and consultancy giant EY has delayed the start of jobs for some of its new hires amid an industry slowdown. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that around 200 US recruits due to join EY-Parthenon, the firm's strategy division, in either November or January will now not begin work until mid-2024. EY confirmed the deferrals to Business Insider on Monday, saying in a statement the decision reflected "the current M&A environment and our business needs." "This will help ensure that our new joiners have the quality and breadth of assignments to ensure a successful start and strong professional trajectory," it added. Advertisement The firm has also reduced the number of internships available next summer and cut pay by roughly 2% for some of its US partners, the FT reported. EY-Parthenon Bosses explained the decision on an internal call, saying that the disappointing market for M&A deals and limited private equity activity had slowed advisory revenue growth more than expected since the start of the firm's fiscal year in July, the FT reported. Related stories EY said in its statement to Business Insider that the affected recruits would receive stipends to assist them in the interim period. A source told the FT that the stipends would be between $12,000 and $35,000. It's the second year running that the Big Four firm has delayed start dates for new hires. EY pushed back start dates twice in 2023 and also made at least 300 job cuts in its advisory wing. Advertisement But it is not alone in scaling back. Major competitors like Deloitte , PwC, and KPMG have also been struggling with slower demand for their consultancy services. M&A activity, a key source of demand for consultancies, has declined since 2022. The number of M&A transactions was down 25% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to PwC's report on Global M&A Industry trends . The downturn in demand has hit especially hard after many firms hired during the pandemic to handle growth as companies flocked to them for advice on navigating the pandemic. Now, without enough work to go around, they're shedding jobs. However, consulting firm bosses are optimistic about a rebound in the M&A market and the promise of returns on AI and future technologies. Advertisement Though transaction volumes were down globally, the value of M&A deals rose by 5% in the first half of 2024. That was largely driven by megadeal activity in the technology and energy sectors, according to PwC.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals USA Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a Swiss biopharma firm, focuses on worker well-being and DEI. Purvi Tailor, head of human resources in its US business, is on BI's Workforce Innovation board .

A lot of companies say they are like a family, but at Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a privately owned biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Switzerland, family-centrism is part of doing business. "In the US, we are a leader in several therapeutic areas, including reproductive medicine, orthopedics, and gastroenterology," said Purvi Tailor, Ferring's head of human resources in the US. "Our mission is to help people build families and live better lives. It's a purpose that the employees that work here can feel very connected to." Tailor joined Ferring in 2021 following roles at Johnson & Johnson, American Express, and JP Morgan. She said that Ferring has grown more intentional about focusing on worker well-being, which is particularly important for the highly competitive field of healthcare. "The war for talent is always on and the best talent always have options," she said. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. What are the benefits for companies focused on worker well-being? Our overarching philosophy is that if our workers have a good sense of well-being , ultimately, it helps our business be that much more successful. We've defined well-being in a holistic way , so it's not just about physical well-being; it's also about mental well-being and financial well-being. We've implemented various initiatives in the last two to three years that focus on each of those. You can provide a lot of tools and resources, but if you don't have the right culture within the company that people are experiencing, that obviously has a much more detrimental impact on employee experience. So, our approach is twofold. First, the benefits and the policies. And second, creating the right type of workplace that people want to be a part of. What specific programs are targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion? Relative to other companies that I've worked for, in some ways we've had the luxury to start a little bit later. Whereas some companies have been doing this for 20 years, for us it became more of a burning platform over the last couple of years. Since Covid and all the various things that have happened since, having an inclusive culture has really become one of the more important things for us. Because inclusion is something that can be very personal and difficult, we're partnering with an external event vendor to create smaller group experiences. We put a lot of things on the table and really try to make it an inclusive environment for understanding, sharing stories, and talking about different scenarios that happen in the workplace. We used scenarios that we've seen either happen at Ferring or outside, but real, lived, everyday kind of things that actually happen. Leaders found that really meaningful because it gave them an opportunity in a very safe environment to explore those situations and recognize them when they see them. The goal is to make sure that when they go back to their offices or desks, they're like, 'Okay, actually, I'm gonna be able to use that as I start to see things.' As Ferring has grown in the US, you've had to start many programs from scratch. What advice do you have for other companies that are just getting started thinking about DEI and worker well-being initiatives? What's really important is to ensure that whatever you're doing, you can connect it with the values of your company. With all of the various things that we're doing, especially in the wellness and DEI space, they align well with our values and our mission of helping people live better lives. It needs to come from an authentic place. Because it's sort of obvious when people are faking it. Our head of DEI in the US has so much passion for this space, and that really drives her as an individual and her purpose. The quality of what she puts out is remarkable, and she's able to create the right narrative that employees and leaders who are in positions to share it are able to grab some of that enthusiasm. What policies demonstrate your focus on worker well-being? One of the biggest things we've done in the last two years is a fertility benefit program called Building Families at Ferring with unlimited financial support for your journey, whether that's IVF, surrogacy, or adoption. So it covers all the many pathways that people could take to build a family. It also offers 26 weeks of paid parental leave and the policy is agnostic of your marital status and your family structures. It's truly a benefit for all that want to build a family. It's so core to our business. We thought we needed to give back to employees in the same way that we want to show up in the marketplace. What workforce issues are commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry? Attrition is systemic; it's just the norm. Over the last few years, we've managed to really stabilize the organization from an attrition perspective more so than we ever have in the previous five years. For us, retention of our talent is critical, as I know it is for all companies. You want to retain the best and make sure that they're developing and getting to whatever their aspirations are. Pharma is very competitive. We recently launched a uro-oncology business, and in the early part of this year, we hired about 60 people with roles across functions, including sales, marketing, finance, and medical. If the pharma market is generally very competitive, oncology is even more so. The things that we can do to make this a great place to work are a big part of how we approach that piece of talent management. Healthcare Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

Morning Bid: Tech, banks spark new US records as China relapses Read full article FILE PHOTO: A Wall Street sign is pictured outside the New York Stock Exchange · Reuters Reuters Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 11:09 AM 4 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan The U.S. bond market returns from holiday to find Wall Street stocks soaring ever higher to new records, with Big Tech and Big Banks stirring earnings season excitement even as China's markets turn tail on demand worries and stimulus doubts. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones posting fresh record finishes, with the former rapidly homing in on 6,000 after a 22% rise for the year so far and the Dow closing above 43,000 for the first time. With Taiwan's giant chipmaker TSMC, the main producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, expected to report a 40% leap in third-quarter earnings on Thursday and Europe's ASML reporting tomorrow, Tech stocks led the latest leg higher. The semiconductor index jumped 1.8% to a more than two-month high on Monday - aided by the 6.8% advance by Arm and a 2.4% surge in market heavyweight Nvidia to its best ever close. That lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.39 trillion - just shy of Apple's $3.52 trillion and above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. The Nasdaq is now back within 1% of the record high it set in July. But attention will flip back to financials on Tuesday, with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and State Street reporting alongside pharma giant Johnson & Johnson. The first blush of bank results on Friday saw that sector's shares surge and estimates of annual profit growth for financials have doubled to 4% since the start of the month. Overall, forecasts for the annual S&P500 earnings expansion in Q3 are for dip this quarter to 5%, with the biggest drag from energy and materials. But the ebullience is all about an expected quick return to double-digit growth for the index in the next quarter and right through next year. And there's little in the robust economic news to make investors reconsider that idea. Bank of America's latest monthly fund manager survey showed global investor optimism and equity allocations recorded the biggest jumps this month since June 2020. Cash allocations dropped to 3.9% while equity exposure rose to a net 31% overweight - and bond allocations suffered a record drop to a net 15% underweight. With stock index futures marginally off ahead of Tuesday's bell, the biggest drag remained energy stocks - with oil prices falling anew. U.S. crude slid as much as $4 to near two-week lows below $70 per barrel on the back of a weaker global demand outlook due to struggling China and after a media report said Israel is willing not to strike Iranian oil targets, easing fears of a major supply disruption. Story continues The world oil market is heading for a sizeable surplus in the new year, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. The annual decline in crude oil prices is running at more than 20% again - a balm for the returning Treasury market that's been so recently agitated by sticky U.S. inflation readouts. The dollar stepped back a touch as a result, although the euro remained on the back foot ahead of the widely expected European Central Bank interest rate cut on Thursday. But China's markets suffered again on Tuesday, reflecting concern about domestic demand in the world's second biggest economy - with persistent doubts that a recent burst of policy stimulus can get across a property-led slide in growth. A brewing trade war with Europe and geopolitical tensions surrounding China's war games around Taiwan this week and the upcoming U.S. election all dampen any optimism there. The Shanghai Composite slumped 2.5% in heavy trading into Tuesday's close there, while the blue-chip CSI300 lost 2.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.7% and the offshore yuan skidded to a one-month low. A report from Caixin Global that China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan ($850 billion) over three years to fund ongoing stimulus seemed to have little effect and investors say they want to hear more detail soon. Elsewhere, sterling perked up even after news that British pay grew at its slowest pace in more than two years in the three months to August and with vacancies falling again. And in European earnings, Ericsson shares jumped 8% after the Swedish company reported third-quarter sales above expectations as demand for 5G gear rebounded in North America. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * US corporate earnings: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, State Street, PNC, Progressive, Charles Schwab, Omnicom, Johnson & Johnson, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Unitedhealth, United Airlines, JB Hunt etc * New York Fed September manufacturing survey, NY Fed Oct survey of consumer inflation expectations; Canada Sept CPI inflation * Federal Reserve Board Governor Adriana Kugler, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic all speak.

Advertisement Million-dollar houses aren't what they used to be, as homebuyers across the US can attest. Gone are the days when seven-figure sums were automatically associated with massive homes on picturesque properties. In fact, in some of the nation's competitive markets, $1 million is nothing more than the price of admission to home ownership. US property values have soared since the financial crisis during a widespread housing shortage that created a home affordability crisis for buyers. The multi-decade-high inflation surge during and after the pandemic also contributed to home-price appreciation. This housing-market boom is best exemplified by major cities in California, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. The median cost of a home in those markets has nearly doubled in the past decade — from $420,300 in 2014 to $854,800 now and $769,600 to $1,449,000 respectively, according to data from the National Association of Realtors cited by the real-estate site Zoocasa. Advertisement Most homebuyers will be out of luck looking in the Golden State, which has seven of the 10 priciest housing markets in the US and is expected to soon have four cities where the typical single-family home costs more than $2 million — including San Jose, San Francisco's Bay Area neighbor. Persistent property-price growth means home affordability will probably remain stretched, even as mortgage rates recede to lower levels . That means buyers may still have limited options. "As prices creep up higher and higher, future home buyers may look outside of these large metros if income growth doesn't start to keep pace with the cost of housing," Zoocasa's Mackenzie Scibetta wrote in a mid-October report . Though many families are set to be priced out of this market, those who can swing a home purchase may want to consider it before property prices rise even further in the coming decade. Advertisement "While rising prices may seem daunting, they also offer the promise of long-term equity gains, providing stability and a solid return on investment down the road," Scibetta wrote. 18 top cities for real-estate investors No real-estate analyst can predict exactly how much or how quickly home prices will rise, though past gains can be a solid harbinger of what's ahead. With that in mind, Zoocasa researchers compiled data on single-family home-price growth from 40 large US markets dating back to 2014 and then extrapolated them out over the next decade to estimate when cities would see their median home prices breach the $1 million mark. Factors such as interest rates and the economic climate will certainly change, though this can be a solid starting point for buyers or real-estate investors who are comparing markets to buy in. Advertisement "While growth rates offer a helpful estimate, they may not hold steady if the market experiences drastic changes," Scibetta wrote. "However, they can still provide a general sense of where prices could head in the future." Of the 40 metropolitan areas used in this analysis, Business Insider limited the list to cities with prices no more than 50% higher than the US median home price, which was $422,100 in the second quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors . That means the cutoff point was $633,150. Below are 18 cities with homes that cost $633,150 or less in Q2 that are set to be million-dollar markets by the end of 2035, sorted by which are on pace to reach the $1 million threshold the fastest. Along with each reasonably priced real-estate market are its median home price and projections for the years ahead, as well as the home-price growth rate from 2014 to 2024 that it's based on.

Advertisement This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Annie Cole, the 35-year-old founder of Money Essentials for Women in Vancouver, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity. In 2012, I got my first job out of college as a social worker , earning $26,000. After two years of emotionally hard work, I pivoted into education. I started working in a university's student academic resource center, helping first-year and at-risk students navigate the college experience. Two years later, I was promoted into an academic advising role. Next, I worked as a research coordinator until I finished my EdD program and got a research analyst job with a global ed-tech nonprofit. I loved and excelled at my work, and I received two executive promotions and several raises. Advertisement Still, this year felt like the perfect time to step away from my VP role and make two big moves: spend more time with my family and launch my own business. It was scary, but I knew I was ready. I moved into a part-time consulting role for my old company and went all-in on building out my financial coaching business, Money Essentials for Women . I've set myself up to retire at age 45 in 10 years, but transitioning from a $26,000 salary to an early retirement plan came in phases. Phase 1: Changing my money mindset When I was about to finish my EdD program, I started searching for jobs, and something clicked. I was only making $32,000. I opened up Indeed and set my filters for jobs that paid $40,000, which seemed like a reasonable salary increase. Advertisement Then I had this thought pop into my mind: What if you just went for something bigger? What about $60,000? I only applied for higher-paying jobs, and within a few months, I got a research analyst job with a $60,000 salary. I got nearly a $30,000 salary jump just because I changed my mind about my worth. Related stories Phase 2: Learning how to provide massive value Getting promoted isn't just handed to you — it's truly earned. Sometimes, I just wanted a clear job description, to show up to do that job, then go home and not think about work. I received my promotions because I didn't just show up and want to be told what to do. I showed up daily and asked myself, How can I help this company reach its biggest strategic goals quicker and more efficiently? How can I directly contribute to those goals every day? Advertisement It takes grit, forward-thinking, and hard work to help a new company grow, and I was up for the challenge. The more value I provided to the company, the more I was rewarded with promotions and raises. Phase 3: Investing I always invested in my retirement account, even when making $26,000. Once I started making more money, I became aggressive with my investment goals. I started reading personal finance books and following financial influencers online, and I slowly learned everything from how the stock market worked to different retirement and investment accounts. I invested in my traditional retirement account, a Roth IRA , and a brokerage account. I kept my budget as minimal as possible to focus on front-loading my investment accounts while I was young. Advertisement My husband and I also added our first real-estate investment in 2023, which simultaneously gives us rental income and home market value growth. Phase 4: Thinking beyond the 9-to-5 Trading my time for money is great, but it will always be limited. I'm setting up additional income sources to make money when I'm not actively working on them. I just launched a two-week online program for my financial coaching business that women can go through asynchronously. I also recently wrote an ebook I sell for $24.99 that captures all of my best tips in one place. This year, I'll make about $60,000 from real estate rental income, $130,000 from consulting and coaching work, and about $30,000 in investment account growth. Advertisement I have $345,000 invested right now I'll focus heavily on investing over the next 10 years (about $45,000 annually) and expect a 10% annual growth rate. When I turn 45, I'll have over $1.6 million. Using the 4% rule would give me just under $65,000 to live on annually when I retire, which is higher than my budget now. The above is based on my investment portfolio, which doesn't consider my real-estate investment property, the equity in my primary residence, and continued income from my business's online courses and books that will still pay me after I'm 45. Here's what I'm doing to ensure the plan works The traditional definition of retirement is when you quit working for good and live off your investments and savings. Most recently, though, the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) has expanded this definition. Advertisement Now, you might "retire" from your full-time job in your 50s but keep a 10-hour-per-week job at Starbucks to supplement your income (this is called Barista FIRE, where you work part-time into retirement). I aim for a traditional retirement when I reach 45. I'm open to the possibility that I might want to keep running my own business by then. For me, it's all about having options. I do these three things consistently to make sure I stay on track: I use a personal financial tracker every single month to track my spending, income, and investments. I built my tracker years ago because I couldn't find one that met my needs online. I know exactly how much I need to save, spend, and invest to reach my goals, and I stay on track with my commitments. I used to think investing so much would feel depriving, but I don't miss that money. I fill my days with things that are fulfilling and free or low-cost. I'm not afraid to adjust as life happens. If a trip or a chance to throw a party for my best friend's engagement comes up, I will go for it. Life is too precious not to take advantage of those special moments. Advertisement You don't have to make a lot of money to invest enough to retire early Setting aside even the tiniest amount of money can seem like a waste of time when the alternative is to spend it now on a new shirt, better groceries, or toys for your kids. If you start making more money, it's just as hard. Lifestyle creep is real, and you'll probably find other things to spend your money on, no matter how much you make. The best way to invest more is to envision how that will benefit you and your loved ones. Every time I invest, I know I'm giving my future self a gift. I'm multiplying every single dollar I worked so hard to earn. Even in my 30s, I'm already reaping the rewards and seeing my account grow beyond six figures. Every investment is worth it, no matter how small. Advertisement Want to share your early retirement story? Email Lauryn Haas at lhaas@businessinsider.com.

How did speculation in companies that might exist nearly catch up to $1.1 trillion of private equity speculation in companies that do exist? And why did that torrent of money ruin so much? As we’ve previously discussed , wealth flocked to corporate equity to chase stories that could still come true - what poker players call outs . VC funds created even more outs, bundling otherwise unlikely startups and promising that only a few had to come true. Thanks for reading Cold Water! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe Massive unicorns were needed to carry all that deadweight, and it turns out that even fluffy and harmless things are absolutely terrifying if you make them big enough. It’s the Stay Puft Short Term Rental App Lighting the DoD’s R&D Budget on Fire… Three Times VC funds knew they were putting $300 billion a year into worthless companies at the bubble’s peak, because a typical fund looks like this: 🦄 10% of companies are home runs that provide nearly all the fund’s returns 😑 30% of companies pay for themselves, and maybe give some modest return 💩 60% of companies are complete failures that go to zero On top of this power distribution, funds had to get an absolutely massive pile of cash into play. They never know exactly who will win or lose, but they chased more and more marginal deal flow to get everything on the table. VC funds now needed to find a hundred unicorns per year to keep their aggregate returns above a Fidelity IRA. Follow the Unicorn Unicorn Hunting Off the top of your head, you can probably think of a few ways of making a billion dollar company. For example: A B2B SaaS Analytics company with $70 million in growing ARR. Doable with a decent product, a great inside sales team, and a few years to ramp up. A Government Contractor with $80 million in annual EBITDA. Doable with govie relationships across multiple programs, access to primes, and a decade or so to ramp up past performance. A war helps. A Social Network with 5 million daily users. Doable if you find the right niche, get some sticky viral growth going, and target countries with good GDP/capita. These aren’t that weird. But the funds need 100 winners, and they can’t all be B2B SaaS Analytics Platforms . Every VC company needs a path to a billion dollar valuation. Ideally multi-billion. So what does a billion dollar dog food company look like in real life? Sure, you have an Excel model… but what does it look like to feed a million dogs? Where are you going to get a half million pounds of meat every single day? What if you keep growing? Twenty more herds like this and you’ve got one day’s breakfast! Hundreds of Marshmallow Men Ghostbusters (1983) isn’t just a top five action-comedy; it’s a prescient look into the weirdness of a unicorn-dominated world. When the Ghostbusters were forced to choose the form of the Destroyer of New York, they tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something that could never destroy us. Oops. Ray : I tried to think of the most harmless thing… something that could never destroy us… Mr. Stay Puft. Venkman : Nice thinking, Ray Ray : We used to roast Stay Puft Marshmallows. By the fire. At Camp Waconda… Venkman : Ray has gone by-by Egon… what have you got left? Egon : Sorry Venkman, I’m terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought. Ray just needs some seed funding The Ghostbusters aren’t alone. Tony, Evan, Andy, and Stanley tried to think of the most harmless thing: a universal food delivery service, expanding the options from just Chinese food and pizza. Brian, Nathan, and Joe tried to think of the most harmless thing: people making extra money but renting out their spare room for the night. Travis and Garrett tried to think of the most harmless thing: people making extra money by giving people car rides. Mark tried to think of the most harmless thing: keeping track of your friends, and organizing group photos. With comments! Those were the innocuous founding ideas behind DoorDash, AirBnB, Uber, and Facebook. At scale, they would ruin communities, put restaurants out of business, destroy the dream of home ownership, and eventually undermine democracy itself. Your fries are soggy, your dasher hates you, the restaurant is going out of business, and DoorDash loses a billion dollars a year. Planning for Massive Success Now that they know those could do so much damage, founders looking for VC funding might think harder about their own ideas. What’s the society-destroying version of bringing back extinct species through gene editing ? Not the current business model, or the next one. The one at massive scale that makes them a unicorn. It’s probably not the problem we’re all thinking of . Uber and AirBnB grew almost in lock-step. Both sets of founders thought that they were on the road to improving society... based on their original idea. Both were unlocking stagnant supply, reducing waste and helping people make money. And they were right at first, as they helped users monetize extra beds and cars for extra cash. But there simply wasn’t enough extra stuff to hit the scale they needed. They tried encouraging some users users to buy more beds and cars to turn into full-time businesses. Then those users grew to be most of their users. Eventually, they induced so much demand for beds and cars amongst entrepreneurs that they made them less affordable for consumers. Photo by Max Böhme on Unsplash Each company is now valued around $100b. And rents in tourist areas have become unaffordable. Would their younger selves have gone down this path if they knew where it led? Maybe, maybe not. Breathing Room Maybe the VC funds themselves will consider whether they actually work at this scale. Too much wealth flowing into VC exploded assets under management, and caused inefficient investment (not your fund, of course, I mean the other ones). Unicorns had to chase society-bending hyper growth to drag the resulting deadweight ahead of the S&P 500, and that was before the half trillion dollars thrown in during 2021. The bump in interest rates has cooled things down. Funds, LPs, and founders have some breathing room to consider whether this all makes sense. Is there a billion-dollar version of every idea? Do they need to maximize AUM? Do most funds even beat the market? Maybe they’ll just put it all in bitcoin. Photo by Kristijan Arsov on Unsplash Thanks for reading Cold Water!

When you take assets that are underutilized by their owners, and shift to a rental model to allow more efficient utilization of said assets, you increase the value of those assets tremendously, and effectively increase collective wealth. To the extent it gets ugly, it's when you start maximizing how much value you extract out of the model. If you extract nearly all the value you've added, then the net benefit for everyone else is pretty minimal. This is where competition is supposed to step in to balance things out...

Advertisement In the latest sign of a resurgence in Wall Street dealmaking , Goldman Sachs reported a 45% jump in profits driven by gains in key business lines, including M&A advisory and equity and debt underwriting. The bank on Tuesday posted a profit of $2.99 billion for the three months that ended in September, up 45% from the same time last year. Revenue of $12.7 billion increased 7% over last year. The results beat analysts' expectations and set the stage for Goldman's executives to discuss why Wall Street may be at the cusp of a surge in corporate dealmaking activity . They cited lower interest rates, a strong economy, and higher demand for corporate financing. "We see significant pent-up demand from our clients," CEO David Solomon said in a call to discuss earnings. "The beginning of the rate-cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity." Advertisement Solomon said the M&A market still has a long way to go to reach historical 10-year averages. But he suggested there are reasons to be hopeful in a call that had one stock analyst asking about the potential for an "M&A supercycle." (Solomon didn't dismiss the idea, saying that 10-year averages could theoretically go up if much of the pent-up demand is released all at once.) It's not just M&A that's seeing signs of a comeback. Lower rates could also boost demand for corporate lending, IPOs , stock issuance, and more. Here are five key takeaways from the company's third-quarter earnings call. Advertisement Investment banking revenues are up Investment banking revenues over the last 9 months Screenshot Investment-banking revenues grew 20% over last year to $1.86 billion. But as the above slide shows, this wasn't a quarterly blip. Fees earned from M&A advice and debt and stock underwriting are up 24% this year versus the first nine months of 2023, including a 41% surge in debt underwriting. Goldman CFO Denis Coleman said equity-capital-markets activity, such as public stock issuances, "are still well below long-term averages." But in the last nine months, activity has surged 31%. Solomon, meanwhile, said it's only a matter of time before financial sponsors, a fancy term for private-equity firms , start transacting again. Sponsors have been "slower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity," Solomon explained. "Some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we have highlighted. And I do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next six, 12, 24 months." Advertisement Equity trading revenues surged A bar chart showing Goldman's investment banking and trading revenues Screenshot Revenues from trading, another key segment of the global banking and markets division, were also up. The firm reported $3.5 billion in equities trading revenue, up 18% over last year. That was offset by declines in the firm's fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading, which declined 12% to just under $3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, however, Goldman's FICC trading operation is up 4% versus last year, thanks in part to a 32% gain in revenues tied to the financing of FICC trades. (See the prior slide for more info.) Goldman's equities trading division is up 12% for the year. Volatility in the markets has created anxiety for traders, Solomon said. "This is an environment that is filled with uncertainty," he said, creating a need for clients to "constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping." Advertisement Demand for loans will only grow as interest rates decline Goldman's 3Q lending broken down by segment Screenshot While lending remains muted, Solomon highlighted several areas of potential growth as interest rates decline, including loans to high-net-worth individuals and more direct lending to corporations. The bank, Solomon said, has made a "strategic decision" to invest in lending for "ultra-high-net-worth" clients, adding that he sees plenty of room for growth . "While we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like JPMorgan and I would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability." Goldman also sees growing opportunities in corporate lending. The bank has long been a lender of leveraged loans and high-yield debt. But as interest rates start to cool, Goldman executives said they see more room to grow the bank's direct and private-lending books. Solomon said the firm is unique in its ability to syndicate, underwrite, and distribute loans. "We have an ability to direct lend. We have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs," he said. "The needs might be different in different transactional situations. So we like our positioning there." Advertisement Goldman continues to attract investments in its assets and wealth management business Assets under supervision hit a record $3.1 trillion Screenshot Goldman's commitment to growing its asset-and-wealth-management business also appears to be paying off as investors seek help managing a difficult market environment. Goldman's assets under supervision swelled to a record $3 trillion in the third quarter, thanks to net inflows of $66 billion. Some of that — $17 billion — came from an increase in assets through wealth management, wherein Goldman manages the portfolios of high-net-worth clients. Accounting for that growth, all in all, the bank reached total clients assets in wealth management of $1.6 trillion. Another $13 billion was sourced through the firm's institutional client channels. Goldman reorganized its asset-and-wealth-management unit two years ago, and it now encompasses products ranging from administering wealthy clients' portfolios to private credit and equity capital to managing assets for large financial institutions, like pensions. In recent years, Goldman leaders have made clear the importance of expanding the bank's footprint in this area. Solomon last year called it "the real story of opportunity for growth for us in the coming years" in a 2023 interview with CNBC , detailing the bank's strategy after its retreat from consumer banking. The increase in wealth-management assets is driving a need for additional staffing, the bank said. Goldman "continued to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading lending offerings to clients," Solomon said. Advertisement The consumer-banking retreat continues Consumer lending is waning Screenshot Meanwhile, the firm continues to withdraw from consumer banking . That function is housed in its platform-solutions division but was formerly combined with wealth management until the bank's 2022 reorganization. Solomon called it a "narrowing" of Goldman's "consumer footprint." The goal, the executives said, was to draw down the consumer activities the bank was heavily invested in a few years ago to the point that their impact becomes "negligible."

Play Share How will external market changes and internal restructuring affect one of the most storied venture capital firms in the world? Subscribe: Apple Podcasts Spotify RSS All episodes All episodes Details Transcript October 15, 2024 Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm founded in 1972, grew to become one of the most storied venture capital firms in the world. The firm’s investment track record includes the names of some of the largest global companies. But the venture capital industry began facing new challenges in 2022, and investors were increasingly cautious. At that time Sequoia also began restructuring the firm and made other changes to their core identity. What would all of this mean for the future of Sequoia, and would the firm still be able to maintain their historical dominance? Harvard Business School senior lecturers Jo Tango and Christina Wallace discuss their case, “ Sequoia Capital .” BRIAN KENNY: In her 2013 blog post titled, “Welcome to the Unicorn Club,” venture capitalist, Aileen Lee, coined a term that has come to define the benchmark for investors the world over. Unicorns, that is privately held startups that are valued at $1 billion or more, are more common today than they were in 2013 when there were just 39 firms that met that definition. Today, the number is closer to fourteen-hundred and competition among the relatively small number of VC firms to find the next unicorn is fierce. For those who are keeping score, Sequoia Capital with 133 unicorns to its credit, sits squarely in the upper echelon. The firms it has invested in have come to represent more than 25% of the Nasdaq, or $1.4 trillion dollars in value. But on a business premised on venture, there are no sure bets and even survival isn’t guaranteed. Today on Cold Call , we welcome co-authors, Jo Tango and Christina Wallace, to discuss the case, “ Sequoia Capital .” I’m your host, Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network. Jo Tango is a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, where he teaches a course on venture capital and private equity, and also exited three unicorn companies. Welcome, Jo. JO TANGO: Thanks for having me. BRIAN KENNY: Great to have you back on the show. Christina Wallace is also a senior lecturer who teaches a course on launching tech ventures, and she is the author of a book called, The Portfolio Life . Welcome back, Christina. CHRISTINA WALLACE: Happy to be here. BRIAN KENNY: So, this will be fun. I found this case to be very interesting. And one thing about HBS is we have deep roots in the VC world. It’s something that the school is proud of. It’s part of our heritage. And so, I think it’ll be interesting for people to hear about sort of the VC world, the culture, and Sequoia’s place in it. I really enjoyed the case, so thank you for writing it. I know you have a couple of other authors. Do you want to mention the other authors on the case? JO TANGO: Yes, we have two other colleagues, Sri and Johnson, who helped us with this and we’re grateful for them. BRIAN KENNY: We can’t fit four guests in the studio, so that’s why we settled with the two of you, which is great. Jo, I’m going to ask you to start by telling us what the central issue is in the case and what your cold call is when you start the discussion in the classroom. JO TANGO: Yes, it’s the summer of 2023. The new managing partner of Sequoia is going around meeting their investors around the world, supposedly 50 of them, to try to explain to them the changes that have happened. Partners have left. They slashed the size of their crypto fund. And their China-India operations have been spun off. So, I would open the case by asking students, “Sequoia: is this a change or a decline?” And start that way. BRIAN KENNY: Christina, let me turn to you for a second. Why did you all decide to write this case? Why was it important? CHRISTINA WALLACE: I think anyone who’s been paying attention to the venture capital world in the last few years has noted the roller coaster that has been VC. We go from a boom cycle, where valuations are insane and there’s money to flow everywhere, to very quickly that money drying up and people getting a little bit more tight-fisted. And Sequoia, obviously one of the behemoths in this industry, so everyone is keeping an eye on what Sequoia is doing. And out of that, as Jo has mentioned, some pretty significant changes. Everything from sort of retrenching from this global firm footprint to backing away from crypto and watching to see what they’re going to do in AI. These trends that they had really leaned into quickly. So, I think it’s something very timely. It’s something very interesting as we’re looking at the industry as a whole and a leader within it. And honestly, any chance I have to work with Jo, I say yes. BRIAN KENNY: There you go. The world is so different today than when Sequoia first started, and we teased that a little bit in the intro. But basically, at that time there were many fewer players in the VC space. There were far fewer firms who would meet that definition. But things have really changed since then. So, Jo, maybe you can give us a little bit of background for people who aren’t as familiar with Sequoia Capital. And the protagonist in this case is Don Valentine. What was his vision for success for the company? JO TANGO: So, it’s interesting you say that, because Don Valentine was known for a person who fostered deep inquiry and total bluntness. It might be apocryphal, but supposedly there was a sign in his office that said, “Who cares?” And apparently, when he sat in on pitches by entrepreneurs, he would often interrupt and say, “Who cares?” And he was very good at focusing the partnership and focusing entrepreneurs on what they would need to do to be successful. Or to use some HBS language, he was the king of high standards. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. So, let me switch back to you, Christina. So, the first home run, I guess, that they had was Atari. And for people who don’t know what Atari is, because this goes way back, maybe you can describe that and talk about how that sort of set the stage for their future success. CHRISTINA WALLACE: Atari is the OG video game company, right? Anyone who grew up loving gaming first learned the company named Atari. And I think what’s so notable here is Don Valentine, he was a working class guy. He grew up, his father was a truck driver, his mom was a homemaker. He got a degree in chemistry, went off to the Navy, and then kind of made his way. And has a working history in the go-to-market side of a firm. He’s not a technologist by training, which a lot of the early venture capital partners are. So, what’s so interesting is he makes this first home run in Atari and a few more kind of tech firms behind that. It sort of sets the stage to say, “Okay, I know what I’m talking about. I’ve got good taste. I can vet the tech.” But very specifically, he and Sequoia are known for caring about the market and the go-to market as much as the technology, as much as the entrepreneur. And I think that speaks to one of the reasons why they’ve probably been so successful, that they’re very attuned to, “What is the customer need? Will this be pulled out of the companies that we’re investing in? Or are they going out and trying to make fetch happen?” BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, what are some of the other big names that they invested in early on? CHRISTINA WALLACE: Everything from eBay and PayPal to… JO TANGO: Apple. Yahoo. BRIAN KENNY: I’ve heard of those. JO TANGO: Airbnb. Google. CHRISTINA WALLACE: All of them. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. JO TANGO: FTX. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Oh, yeah. We’ll talk about that a little bit later, I think. Maybe not in any great detail. So, Jo, what are some of the things that they look at when they’re evaluating potential companies to invest in? JO TANGO: Yeah, to Christina’s point, they look at the market. So, if you think about how VCs pick deals or projects, do they pick the jockey? The founder? Do they lean on the horse, the product, or do they emphasize the racetrack? Which is the market. Don Valentine was known from very early on saying, “It’s all about the market. I can’t improve a bad market. I cannot create a market from scratch. But if I have a great market, I can find the right horse and the right jockey.” So, they always have been very focused on market spaces. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, Christina, is that different or like what other firms do? CHRISTINA WALLACE: It certainly stands out as somewhat of a unique proposition. I think there are a lot of VCs that say, “We are looking at founders first.” Where the founder, the founder, the founder is the talent, and, like, “I don’t really care what they’re building, find me the right founder, and we’ll back them, and we’ll see where they go.” And so, there are others that follow the technology trends and they’re like, “We are only investing in AI. We’re only investing in these spaces, and let’s find the right opportunities in that space.” And I think it’s a really interesting kind of industry agnostic perspective to say, “I want a market that is growing, that it has experiencing a major need,” and that there is an opportunity to exploit. In maybe a slightly less worrisome definition of that word. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, I know what you mean. So, this is a two-person dance, right? CHRISTINA WALLACE: Yeah. BRIAN KENNY: So, you’ve got Sequoia on the one hand, who may be looking at markets and potential players within those markets. What about the firms themselves? What do they need to be thinking about when they’re entertaining partnering with a firm like Sequoia? JO TANGO: Well, we actually quote an entrepreneur in the case who said that, “The final pitch meeting at Sequoia was the most intense hour of my life.” And as is also documented in the case, they’re looking for people who are underdogs, who are fearless, and who engage in what Sequoia calls “black and white thinking.” In the sense that people who are thinking in the gray matter and the gray zones all the time are going to lose time. Sequoia seems to want entrepreneurs who can make decisions quickly, maybe fail fast, but then get to the right answer. There’s a certain intensity to the firm that is pretty well-known in the industry. CHRISTINA WALLACE: And I think the firm reflects that. They’re sort of giving off the same vibes that they’re looking for from the founders. We have stories of them wiring millions of dollars to founders literally before the documents are even signed. Where once they make a decision, they move fast. They’re going straight to the deal and saying, “Let’s get this done.” And I think they’re looking for founders who respect that, and see the opportunity to partner with that kind of a thought partner in building these companies. BRIAN KENNY: Well, if you look at the companies that you rattled off before, that they’ve invested in some of those unicorns, the leadership of those companies are known as hard drivers. People who are action-oriented, who are doing anything that they can to make the firm successful. So, that sounds like a successful partnership there. CHRISTINA WALLACE: Yeah, for the most part it’s great, until it’s not. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. CHRISTINA WALLACE: I think the flip side of that coin is simply that is a very specific way of seeing the world, of looking at opportunity. And when you have both sides of the partnership with that very specific viewpoint, you are by definition, going to have some blind spots. You’re going to have things that you’re both missing. And I think that that comes out when we look at some of these deals like FTX and others, where you sort of look at that from afar and say, “What are they thinking?” BRIAN KENNY: Well, so let’s talk a little bit about that. What drove the teams, maybe it was Don’s decision, maybe it was a collective decision, to make some of these decisions that they did about expanding into global markets and about expanding into categories that may or may not have been proven to be successful? JO TANGO: Well, I think this is the dynamic within a venture firm. If you’re successful, you’ll be tempted to create more success. And expansion can happen one of two ways, you offer a new product. So, do you go from early stage to later stage? What Sequoia has done. Or do you offer a new geographic product to your investors? U.S. only to China, India, and Israel? So, the playbook works, as Christina says, until it doesn’t. And there’s been a long history of firms in the U.S.—Benchmark for example started a European office. It didn’t work out. They spun it off, it became Balderton, which is very successful. So, what we see in business is that sometimes the playbook that gives you success today isn’t the one that will give you success tomorrow. And one of the meta points of the case is this: over time every empire ends, every country falls, and every company fails. And Sequoia is an example, perhaps, of this bigger trend in business, which is, are they on the verge of failing? If so, why? If not, why? And the bigger managerial question really is, as a leader, and we’re in the business of educating leaders who make a difference, is how do you know when you’re at the inflection point and can you peer around corners, given this challenge of sustaining excellence? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and how does your culture help or hinder that process? We talked a little bit about the bluntness of the culture, but there’s also mentions in the case about collaboration and the way that they work together. I’m wondering, where does the culture help and where does it hurt? CHRISTINA WALLACE: Yeah, I think one of the really notable things about their culture is this teamwork. They have this history of saying, “I don’t care if it’s not your portfolio company, if you can help, step up. I don’t care if you’re not on the board, if you’ve got an idea or a relationship, or if you’re the better partner to take this deal, I’m going to hand it off, because we’re all economically benefiting from us being one

Toho Animation Acquires Gkids and Aims to Bring More Japanese Media to the U.S. Skip to content By Isaiah Colbert Published October 15, 2024 | Comments ( 0 ) | ð Copied! The Boy and the Heron. Â© Studio Ghibli In the latest news of surprise business acquisitions and mergers that make sense at first glance, Toho Animation, the self-proclaimed leader in Japanese entertainment, has announced its acquisition of Gkids , a North American animation producer and distributor. Earlier today, Gkids published a press release Â describing its acquisition by the Los Angeles-based Toho as one where Toho would acquire 100% equity from Gkids. At the same time, the other would maintain its independence (and folks in power as CEOs and whatnot) while utilizing Toho’s connections to bolster its commerce and further its reach in the entertainment world. What does all that mean to the average fan of Japanese entertainment and anime? Two mega powers in the industry are combining forces to compete against other companies that are jockeying for our precious attention, such as Disney. A key motivator behind Toho and Gkids’ partnership is the winning success both companies experienced at the box office this past year with Godzilla Minus One and Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron . As Gkids states in its press release, both films earned significant achievements within a week of each other, with the former earning the highest box office revenue for a Japanese live-action film in the states and the third largest-grossing foreign film in U.S. history, and the latter becoming Studio Ghibli’s highest-grossing film in the U.S. And even beyond that, the two aren’t strangers to one another, having collaborated with the theatrical releases of animated films like Spirited Away: Live on Stage , Makoto Shinkai’s Weathering With You , and animation Studio Trigger’s Promare . Reading between Gkids’ press release lines, the two likely decided to perform a fusion dance of sorts after making their presences felt during the most recent awards season (including the Oscars) . To put one’s capitalistic cap on, the two aim to have their combined forces lead to a repeat of their individual successes with the aforementioned award-winning films as a united front. “Gkids will continue to operate as we always haveâwith the same team, the same passion, and the same missionâbut now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company,” Gkids founder Eric Beckman and president David Jesteadt wrote in a joint statement. “This partnership will empower us to bring even more amazing films to North American and global audiences, while we continue to champion animation as a cinematic artform and push the limits of what the medium is capable of. We could not be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. The best is yet to come.” Godzilla Minus One . Image: Toho While Toho has become a household name for many an anime fan thanks to big marquee shonen series like Dragon Ball Z and Jujutsu Kaisen , Gkids has become a bit of a rising star in the cultural zeitgeist. Its North American theatrical distribution and home video releases of Look Back , Dan Da Dan , The First Slam Dunk , and Arcane season one are the most recent money-move examples of Gkids putting itself on the map for fans of Japanese entertainment and animation. Likewise, Toho has been on a future-sighted acquisition spree, recently taking on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off , Dan Da Dan , and Devilman Crybaby animation studio Science Saru. “Through their hard work, vision, and integrity, Gkids has built a unique position in the U.S. market, which dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission,” Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka wrote in the press release. “This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.” Hopefully, this no-brainer acquisition doesn’t lead to an influx of layoffs across Toho or Gkids, as we’ve seen countless times in the video game industry. In the meantime, the likes of Disney and Netflix can look forward to steep competition at both the box office and during awards season. Want more io9 news?

A lot of companies say they are like a family, but at Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a privately owned biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Switzerland, family-centrism is part of doing business. "In the US, we are a leader in several therapeutic areas, including reproductive medicine, orthopedics, and gastroenterology," said Purvi Tailor, Ferring's head of human resources in the US. "Our mission is to help people build families and live better lives. It's a purpose that the employees that work here can feel very connected to." Tailor joined Ferring in 2021 following roles at Johnson & Johnson, American Express, and JP Morgan. She said that Ferring has grown more intentional about focusing on worker well-being, which is particularly important for the highly competitive field of healthcare. "The war for talent is always on and the best talent always have options," she said. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. What are the benefits for companies focused on worker well-being? Our overarching philosophy is that if our workers have a good sense of well-being , ultimately, it helps our business be that much more successful. We've defined well-being in a holistic way , so it's not just about physical well-being; it's also about mental well-being and financial well-being. We've implemented various initiatives in the last two to three years that focus on each of those. You can provide a lot of tools and resources, but if you don't have the right culture within the company that people are experiencing, that obviously has a much more detrimental impact on employee experience. So, our approach is twofold. First, the benefits and the policies. And second, creating the right type of workplace that people want to be a part of. What specific programs are targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion? Relative to other companies that I've worked for, in some ways we've had the luxury to start a little bit later. Whereas some companies have been doing this for 20 years, for us it became more of a burning platform over the last couple of years. Since Covid and all the various things that have happened since, having an inclusive culture has really become one of the more important things for us. Because inclusion is something that can be very personal and difficult, we're partnering with an external event vendor to create smaller group experiences. We put a lot of things on the table and really try to make it an inclusive environment for understanding, sharing stories, and talking about different scenarios that happen in the workplace. We used scenarios that we've seen either happen at Ferring or outside, but real, lived, everyday kind of things that actually happen. Leaders found that really meaningful because it gave them an opportunity in a very safe environment to explore those situations and recognize them when they see them. The goal is to make sure that when they go back to their offices or desks, they're like, 'Okay, actually, I'm gonna be able to use that as I start to see things.' As Ferring has grown in the US, you've had to start many programs from scratch. What advice do you have for other companies that are just getting started thinking about DEI and worker well-being initiatives? What's really important is to ensure that whatever you're doing, you can connect it with the values of your company. With all of the various things that we're doing, especially in the wellness and DEI space, they align well with our values and our mission of helping people live better lives. It needs to come from an authentic place. Because it's sort of obvious when people are faking it. Our head of DEI in the US has so much passion for this space, and that really drives her as an individual and her purpose. The quality of what she puts out is remarkable, and she's able to create the right narrative that employees and leaders who are in positions to share it are able to grab some of that enthusiasm. What policies demonstrate your focus on worker well-being? One of the biggest things we've done in the last two years is a fertility benefit program called Building Families at Ferring with unlimited financial support for your journey, whether that's IVF, surrogacy, or adoption. So it covers all the many pathways that people could take to build a family. It also offers 26 weeks of paid parental leave and the policy is agnostic of your marital status and your family structures. It's truly a benefit for all that want to build a family. It's so core to our business. We thought we needed to give back to employees in the same way that we want to show up in the marketplace. What workforce issues are commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry? Attrition is systemic; it's just the norm. Over the last few years, we've managed to really stabilize the organization from an attrition perspective more so than we ever have in the previous five years. For us, retention of our talent is critical, as I know it is for all companies. You want to retain the best and make sure that they're developing and getting to whatever their aspirations are. Pharma is very competitive. We recently launched a uro-oncology business, and in the early part of this year, we hired about 60 people with roles across functions, including sales, marketing, finance, and medical. If the pharma market is generally very competitive, oncology is even more so. The things that we can do to make this a great place to work are a big part of how we approach that piece of talent management. Healthcare Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

Morning Bid: Tech, banks spark new US records as China relapses Read full article FILE PHOTO: A Wall Street sign is pictured outside the New York Stock Exchange · Reuters Reuters Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 11:09 AM 4 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan The U.S. bond market returns from holiday to find Wall Street stocks soaring ever higher to new records, with Big Tech and Big Banks stirring earnings season excitement even as China's markets turn tail on demand worries and stimulus doubts. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones posting fresh record finishes, with the former rapidly homing in on 6,000 after a 22% rise for the year so far and the Dow closing above 43,000 for the first time. With Taiwan's giant chipmaker TSMC, the main producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, expected to report a 40% leap in third-quarter earnings on Thursday and Europe's ASML reporting tomorrow, Tech stocks led the latest leg higher. The semiconductor index jumped 1.8% to a more than two-month high on Monday - aided by the 6.8% advance by Arm and a 2.4% surge in market heavyweight Nvidia to its best ever close. That lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.39 trillion - just shy of Apple's $3.52 trillion and above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. The Nasdaq is now back within 1% of the record high it set in July. But attention will flip back to financials on Tuesday, with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and State Street reporting alongside pharma giant Johnson & Johnson. The first blush of bank results on Friday saw that sector's shares surge and estimates of annual profit growth for financials have doubled to 4% since the start of the month. Overall, forecasts for the annual S&P500 earnings expansion in Q3 are for dip this quarter to 5%, with the biggest drag from energy and materials. But the ebullience is all about an expected quick return to double-digit growth for the index in the next quarter and right through next year. And there's little in the robust economic news to make investors reconsider that idea. Bank of America's latest monthly fund manager survey showed global investor optimism and equity allocations recorded the biggest jumps this month since June 2020. Cash allocations dropped to 3.9% while equity exposure rose to a net 31% overweight - and bond allocations suffered a record drop to a net 15% underweight. With stock index futures marginally off ahead of Tuesday's bell, the biggest drag remained energy stocks - with oil prices falling anew. U.S. crude slid as much as $4 to near two-week lows below $70 per barrel on the back of a weaker global demand outlook due to struggling China and after a media report said Israel is willing not to strike Iranian oil targets, easing fears of a major supply disruption. Story continues The world oil market is heading for a sizeable surplus in the new year, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. The annual decline in crude oil prices is running at more than 20% again - a balm for the returning Treasury market that's been so recently agitated by sticky U.S. inflation readouts. The dollar stepped back a touch as a result, although the euro remained on the back foot ahead of the widely expected European Central Bank interest rate cut on Thursday. But China's markets suffered again on Tuesday, reflecting concern about domestic demand in the world's second biggest economy - with persistent doubts that a recent burst of policy stimulus can get across a property-led slide in growth. A brewing trade war with Europe and geopolitical tensions surrounding China's war games around Taiwan this week and the upcoming U.S. election all dampen any optimism there. The Shanghai Composite slumped 2.5% in heavy trading into Tuesday's close there, while the blue-chip CSI300 lost 2.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.7% and the offshore yuan skidded to a one-month low. A report from Caixin Global that China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan ($850 billion) over three years to fund ongoing stimulus seemed to have little effect and investors say they want to hear more detail soon. Elsewhere, sterling perked up even after news that British pay grew at its slowest pace in more than two years in the three months to August and with vacancies falling again. And in European earnings, Ericsson shares jumped 8% after the Swedish company reported third-quarter sales above expectations as demand for 5G gear rebounded in North America. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * US corporate earnings: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, State Street, PNC, Progressive, Charles Schwab, Omnicom, Johnson & Johnson, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Unitedhealth, United Airlines, JB Hunt etc * New York Fed September manufacturing survey, NY Fed Oct survey of consumer inflation expectations; Canada Sept CPI inflation * Federal Reserve Board Governor Adriana Kugler, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic all speak. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks * US Treasury sells 3-, 6-month bills (By Mike Dolan; Editing by Peter Graff; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com) View comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement Up next View Comments Advertisement U.S. markets closed Customize Your Dock US Europe Asia Rates Commodities Currencies Cryptocurrencies S&P Futures 5,888.00 -8.25 (-0.14%) Dow Futures 43,134.00 -43.00 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Futures 20,473.75 -45.75 (-0.22%) Russell 2000 Futures 2,250.20 -5.30 (-0.23%) Crude Oil 70.35 -0.21 (-0.30%) Gold 2,745.80 +6.90 (+0.25%) My Portfolios Sign in to access your portfolio Sign in OKLO Oklo Inc. 22.31 +4.08 (+22.38%) WULF TeraWulf Inc. 6.21 +0.97 (+18.51%) ROAD Construction Partners, Inc. 84.70 +10.00 (+13.39%) IONQ IonQ, Inc. 14.76 +1.46 (+10.98%) WRBY Warby Parker Inc. 18.20 +1.65 (+9.97%) NMRA Neumora Therapeutics, Inc. 14.05 -2.44 (-14.80%) RKT Rocket Companies, Inc. 16.33 -1.68 (-9.33%) W Wayfair Inc. 47.34 -4.87 (-9.33%) RNA Avidity Biosciences, Inc. 46.71 -3.74 (-7.41%) VFC V.F.

Advertisement Million-dollar houses aren't what they used to be, as homebuyers across the US can attest. Gone are the days when seven-figure sums were automatically associated with massive homes on picturesque properties. In fact, in some of the nation's competitive markets, $1 million is nothing more than the price of admission to home ownership. US property values have soared since the financial crisis during a widespread housing shortage that created a home affordability crisis for buyers. The multi-decade-high inflation surge during and after the pandemic also contributed to home-price appreciation. This housing-market boom is best exemplified by major cities in California, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. The median cost of a home in those markets has nearly doubled in the past decade — from $420,300 in 2014 to $854,800 now and $769,600 to $1,449,000 respectively, according to data from the National Association of Realtors cited by the real-estate site Zoocasa. Advertisement Most homebuyers will be out of luck looking in the Golden State, which has seven of the 10 priciest housing markets in the US and is expected to soon have four cities where the typical single-family home costs more than $2 million — including San Jose, San Francisco's Bay Area neighbor. Persistent property-price growth means home affordability will probably remain stretched, even as mortgage rates recede to lower levels . That means buyers may still have limited options. "As prices creep up higher and higher, future home buyers may look outside of these large metros if income growth doesn't start to keep pace with the cost of housing," Zoocasa's Mackenzie Scibetta wrote in a mid-October report . Though many families are set to be priced out of this market, those who can swing a home purchase may want to consider it before property prices rise even further in the coming decade. Advertisement "While rising prices may seem daunting, they also offer the promise of long-term equity gains, providing stability and a solid return on investment down the road," Scibetta wrote. 18 top cities for real-estate investors No real-estate analyst can predict exactly how much or how quickly home prices will rise, though past gains can be a solid harbinger of what's ahead. With that in mind, Zoocasa researchers compiled data on single-family home-price growth from 40 large US markets dating back to 2014 and then extrapolated them out over the next decade to estimate when cities would see their median home prices breach the $1 million mark. Factors such as interest rates and the economic climate will certainly change, though this can be a solid starting point for buyers or real-estate investors who are comparing markets to buy in. Advertisement "While growth rates offer a helpful estimate, they may not hold steady if the market experiences drastic changes," Scibetta wrote. "However, they can still provide a general sense of where prices could head in the future." Of the 40 metropolitan areas used in this analysis, Business Insider limited the list to cities with prices no more than 50% higher than the US median home price, which was $422,100 in the second quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors . That means the cutoff point was $633,150. Below are 18 cities with homes that cost $633,150 or less in Q2 that are set to be million-dollar markets by the end of 2035, sorted by which are on pace to reach the $1 million threshold the fastest. Along with each reasonably priced real-estate market are its median home price and projections for the years ahead, as well as the home-price growth rate from 2014 to 2024 that it's based on.

The Election and Gen Z's Housing Problem - CNET X Money The Election and Gen Z's Housing Problem High housing costs are holding younger generations back from the life they want. Katherine Watt Writer Katherine Watt is a CNET Money writer focusing on mortgages, home equity and banking. She previously wrote about personal finance for NextAdvisor. Based in New York, Katherine graduated summa cum laude from Colgate University with a bachelor's degree in English literature. See full bio Katherine Watt Oct. 21, 2024 7:27 a.m. PT 6 min read Tharon Green/CNET The housing affordability crisis isn't just a minor talking point in this year's presidential election. It's a major economic problem for young voters like me. More than nine out of 10 Gen Zers say housing affordability is their top voting concern, outranking issues like education and abortion rights, according to a survey from Redfin. Although high mortgage rates , rising home prices and an undersupply of affordable houses affect homebuyers across all generations, an inaccessible housing market is a particularly acute question for my generation. Owning a home represents a path toward long-term financial stability and wealth . Yet for most of us, the prospect of homeownership feels like a long shot. "Gen Z is aging into their renting and early homebuying years at a time when housing is historically expensive," said Brittany Webb , director of research at the National Housing Conference. "That has made them painfully aware of the impact housing has on their lives." It's also led to apathy among younger generations, who watch economic headwinds come one after another. Homeownership can feel like an impossibility unless you have the benefit of generational wealth and guidance, said Webb. Today's housing market isn't the same one our parents and grandparents experienced. As Gen Zers enter their adult years, they're also dealing with high debt burdens, insecure employment and sluggish wage growth. Those factors are made worse by the increased cost of consumer goods and services, aka inflation. Many young voters are new to the workforce and spend the majority of their paychecks on rent, making it difficult to pay off student debt , much less save enough money to buy a house. More than half of adult Gen Zers say they can't afford to live the life they want, with the high cost of living making them financially dependent on others. Likewise, an increasing number of young adults are turning to live with family. According to recent census data, almost half of zoomers aged 18 to 29 still live with their parents , the highest level since the Great Depression. Ronald Carter, who works as a general contractor in Tacoma, Washington, told me he feels pressure to buy a house but can't even afford a starter home, which costs upward of $300,000. "I make good money but I'd need to be working 80-hour weeks to make that happen," said Carter. Like many others, Carter finds it challenging to afford monthly rent payments , which have increased by more than 30% since 2019, according to Zillow. Meanwhile, wages only grew 20% for the same period. "When I graduated high school, you could find a two-bedroom apartment for $1,000 to $1,500 a month," Carter said. Now, it's closer to $2,200 a month. Carter told me he and his peers have had to make difficult trade-offs to compensate. "You either pay rent and then your utilities or your phone gets turned off -- or you pay the utilities and phone bill so you're late on rent," said Carter. Many financial analysts would argue that the economy is robust. On paper, unemployment is relatively low, wages are increasing and inflation is cooling. Yet today's housing affordability crisis is a more accurate reflection of how younger generations view the economy. Because housing is typically our biggest monthly expense, it affects our ability to pay for anything else, including food and healthcare. When there's no room left in your budget each month, saving tens of thousands of dollars for a down payment feels insurmountable. What the presidential election means for housing affordability Housing affordability has long been a major issue in the US, particularly for the lowest-income Americans, but it rarely takes center stage in presidential elections. However, the surge in mortgage rates and home prices since the pandemic means the crisis is affecting a broader set of voters, particularly middle-class households. In recent months, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have proposed lowering housing costs. Both candidates have commented on the long-running housing supply shortage , which experts agree is a factor in today's housing affordability crisis. One reason home prices have increased so dramatically over the past few decades is that not enough houses are being built to keep up with demand. Expensive land and construction costs, as well as strict zoning and land-usage laws, limit where and what types of homes are built, said Doug McCoy , director of the Center on Real Estate Studies at Indiana University Kelley School of Business. "Housing affordability is a really important part of public policy and part of the American Dream, as well. But I think that's kind of gotten lost," McCoy said. Specifically, there's a critical lack of affordable housing being built in areas where people want to live, said Webb. "Even as we sought to increase housing production in recent years, we were not being intentional about building smaller, more affordable homes," she said. For her part, Harris said she promises to build 3 million new homes by offering a first-of-its-kind tax incentive for builders focused on first-time buyers, as well as extending existing incentives for affordable rental housing construction. On the demand side, Harris said she would provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. Trump, on the other hand, has said his controversial immigration policies (like mass deportations) will help the housing shortage . He also proposed increasing inventory by opening portions of federally owned land (something Harris has also suggested) for large-scale housing construction and reducing zoning and environmental regulations that restrict housing supply. Right now, both plans are merely campaign rhetoric. No president, regardless of who's elected, can change zoning laws, which are decided on the local and state levels. The federal government could, however, influence the direction of those policies via tax incentives or other funding. "It's not that addressing housing affordability is difficult. It's just that it hasn't been a priority," said McCoy. Crafting, strengthening and implementing effective housing policies won't happen overnight, particularly with a divided Congress. "It took us a long time to get here and it will take us a long time to get out," said Webb. Homebuying advice for Gen Zers, from Gen Zers Plenty of us still want to ride what's considered to be America's wealth escalator: establishing financial security and generational wealth through home equity . But over the last roughly three decades, the median wealth gap between homeowners and renters has increased by 70%. If housing doesn't become more affordable, that gap will only widen. Young voters' pessimism about the housing market can be attributed to multiple economic factors, including inflation, debt and high interest rates. The lack of affordable housing affects our day-to-day lives and our future goals, like being able to build a family and retire. Caroline Coladonato , a Gen Zer and real estate agent at Tri-County Suburban Realtors in Pennsylvania, moved back in with her parents to save money for a home purchase. "One of the main reasons I want to buy a home is because it's part of the American Dream," she said. Coladonato said having a better understanding of the homebuying process makes her feel more confident about her prospects. "Part of that comes from my industry experience. I know what programs and resources are available for homebuyers, especially for first-time buyers ," she said. Many of us never learned about homebuying or housing market fundamentals, let alone basic personal finance, in school. Similar to Coladonato, if I didn't cover the housing market and mortgage rates for a living, I'd probably feel a lot worse about being able to afford an eventual home purchase. At the end of the day, how the next administration addresses (or doesn't address) housing affordability isn't within our control. Neither are mortgage rates or home prices. But the more we learn about the process of buying a home and how mortgages work, the better off we'll be. "That's not to say it isn't a tricky market. It is. But I think when you see the steps for yourself, and know that it is possible, you now have a tangible goal to reach toward," said Coladonato. So, I wrote a guide to help me (and you) make that dream of homeownership a reality.

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Oct 16, 2024, 10:40am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Key News Asian equities were largely lower, as Taiwan underperformed following ASML’s earnings miss yesterday, while Thailand and Indonesia managed to outperform. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room throughout the day, despite US-listed China stocks being down significantly yesterday. The recent correction, following the massive stimulus-driven rally, paused on light volumes. Local investors are contemplating tomorrow’s 10 am press conference and Q&A to be held by multiple authorities, including the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Natural Resources, and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank. Leaders will discuss “the relevant situation of promoting the stable and healthy development of the real estate market”. Not surprisingly, Real Estate was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, where it was up +4.4%, and in Mainland China, where it was up 4.72%, though, within MSCI indices, there are just 6 Hong Kong real estate stocks and only 7 in Mainland China. That explains why I like the tasty yields on US dollar-denominated high-yield real estate bonds as a rebound play, though everyone keeps buying US high-yield and ignoring me. Chengdu is pushing through a big real estate and infrastructure development plan, while Mainland media noted that second-tier Chinese cities, including Nanjing and Chengdu, saw strong home buying during Golden Week. There was a massive disparity between Hong Kong-listed stocks today and US-listed China stocks (ADRs) yesterday, which is leading to a bounce today. Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value were Tencent, down -0.29% versus its non-sponsored ADR which was down -4.91%, Meituan, up +1.41% versus its non-sponsored ADR which fell -5.42%, Alibaba, down -0.9% versus its ADR which fell -5.54%, and JD.com which fell -3.12% versus its ADR which fell -9.02%. That explains why we hold the stocks in Hong Kong and not the US! Other names were Kuaishou, down -2.32% versus its ADR which fell -20.58% (the ADR basically doesn’t trade as a FYI), Trip.com, down -1.89% versus its ADR which fell -8.83%, Li Auto, down -0.61% versus its ADR which fell -5.54%, Baidu, down -0.97% versus its ADR which fell -5.19%, and Bilibili, up +1.14% versus its ADR which fell -6.92%. LVMH’s miss was cited as weighing on consumer plays. Southbound Stock Connect was a rare net sell today though Alibaba was back to being a net buy following yesterday’s first net sell day. ASML weighed on technology stocks in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, down -1.02% and -2.76%. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor China isn’t going anywhere geographically or economically, though we are in a bit of a TINA (there is no alternative for the government’s stimulus, housing prices, and getting investors back into the stock market. How do you let Shanghai and Shenzhen fall after telling local citizens to buy? I don’t think you can. My recommendation: think about what’s coming down the road ahead through the windshield and not looking in the rear-view mirror. Reuters had a great indicator of how far along we are in the China equity rally. Reuters interviewed former CIO of the $347 billion California State Teachers Retirement System (CALSTERS), Christopher Ailman, who is the Chairman of the North American chapter of the 300 Club, a group of US and European pension and asset managers. In a recent 300 Club meeting, named ironically for the 300 Spartans who fought the Persians at Thermopylae back in 480 BC. Ailman said that "Money managers on the call agreed that the prices of certain Chinese stocks looked attractive from the technical and fundamental perspectives, but no one indicated they were increasing their Chinese investments. " He added that, despite this, " No one wants to go rushing in before the U.S. election ." Which China stocks in particular do investors find attractive? C’mon, it ain’t banks, energy, materials, or industrials that look attractive! I think it has to be the the "good stuff", i.e., the growth names, which are predominantly listed in Hong Kong! Have any of the 300 Club members bought the rally? Leonidas would be disappointed! The election? What are you afraid of? Trump wins? Do you really think 60% tariffs could be economic reality versus nothing more than campaign rhetoric? In fact, Trump said explicitly in an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago that tariffs are meant to get foreign companies to set up shop in the US and extract other concessions, not as a long-term policy! Shouldn’t you be shorting Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Home Depot if you believe 60% tariffs are coming because those companies are cooked without China? Ailman also validated our thesis about the geographic rewind back into China, stating, “U.S. and Canadian funds were particularly "gun shy" about investing in China right now,” i.e., they will likely be the last ones back in. The first will be the Chinese buying of China, which is occurring based on the Southbound Stock flows from China into Hong Kong and the massive buybacks from the tech entrepreneur-founded internet companies. Next will be Asian investors likely taking a little profit from their historical overweight to US tech stocks, Japan, and India, and using that capital to dip their toes back into cheap China consumer, internet, and technology names. This morning, Bank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey noted that, “Global fund managers increased their allocation to China at India’s expense after Asia’s largest economy unleashed a stimulus package.” India’s average P/E is 24 versus China’s 11. This stunning valuation disparity was a factor as well, though it doesn’t mention India’s massive retail-driven stock option enthusiasm. At the end of the day, big strategic institutional rebalancing to rectify China's underweights has not started yet or, at least, it is in the very early stages. Privately held Xiao Hong Shu, which translates as "Little Red Book" and is often thought of as China’s Instagram, had a leak. The company did not release financial data, though it appears that it landed in the hands of some journalists and investors, likely due to preparation efforts, and security breaches, leading up to a potential IPO. More likely to come on this! The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -0.16% and -1.09%, respectively, on volume that decreased -20.25% from yesterday, which is 176% of the 1-year average. 278 stocks advanced, while 212 declined. Main Board short turnover, which decreased by -40.18% from Thursday, which is 112% of the 1-year average, as 10% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, which was up +4.39%, Materials, up +3.08%, and Financials, up +1.01%. Meanwhile, Consumer Staples fell -1.61%, Information Technology fell -1.03%, and Health Care fell -0.92%. The top-performing subsectors were food & beverage, real estate services, and media. Meanwhile, consumer services, consumer durables were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were high, 2X normal, as Mainland investors sold a net -$198 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a small net buy, and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, which was a large net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board diverged to close +0.05%, -0.45%, and -2.57%, respectively, on volume that was down -15.84% from yesterday, which is 165% of the 1-year average. 2,154 stocks advanced, while 2,762 declined.

The top-performing subsectors were real estate, water, and precious metals. Meanwhile, diversified financials, computer hardware, and semiconductors were among the worst-performing. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were high, at just over 2X the average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index gained versus the US dollar. The Treasury bond curve flattened. Copper and steel fell.

The move gives Toho, which has released everything from Godzilla films to anime classics like “My Hero Academia,” a major expansion in North America and a distribution arm to extend their reach further. Toho is picking up a 100 percent equity share in the company led by founder and CEO Eric Beckman and President Dave Jesteadt. They’ll keep those jobs. GKIDS will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based Toho International. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Related Stories Sony Pictures CEO Blames Union Contracts for Why Productions Are Moving Overseas Danny Ramirez: Joaquin Phoenix’s Exit from Todd Haynes Film Was ‘Definitely Disappointing’ GKIDS was founded in 2009 with the release of the Oscar-nominated “The Secret of Kells.” It was just a two-person company at the time. Since then, 13 different films GKIDS released in North America have been nominated for Best Animated Feature, including last year’s win for Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron.” Toho is a bit older — it was originally founded in 1932. The GKIDS acquisition gives Toho a means to distribute, market, and sell titles (both animated and live action), more widely in the U.S. GKIDS will also help with licensing, merchandising, and other e-commerce operations under the Toho International banner. Toho President and CEO Hiro Matsuoka said in a statement, “Through their hard work, vision, and integrity, GKIDS has built a unique position in the U.S. market, which dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission. This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences. We are honored to be working together with Eric, Dave, and the entire GKIDS team and welcoming them into the Toho family.” “For all GKIDS’ filmmakers, content partners, distribution partners, and especially the fans, this is truly great news,” Beckman and Jesteadt said in a joint statement. “GKIDS will continue to operate as we always have — with the same team, the same passion, and the same mission — but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company. We are truly thrilled to be joining forces with the esteemed and storied Toho, home to Godzilla and Akira Kurosawa, as well as blockbuster anime franchises like ‘My Hero Academia’ and ‘Jujutsu Kaisen.’ This partnership will empower us to bring even more amazing films to North American and global audiences, while we continue to champion animation as a cinematic artform and push the limits of what the medium is capable of. We could not be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. The best is yet to come.” Toho recently acquired the Japanese animation studio Science SARU (“Scott Pilgrim Takes Off,” “DAN DA DAN”) and made an equity investment in Fifth Season (formerly Endeavor Content), the production and distributor behind “Severance” and “Tokyo Vice,” to name a few productions. Toho and GKIDS previously worked together on “Weathering With You” from director Makoto Shinkai, and they also partnered on the stage adaptation of “Spirited Away.” But while Toho has traditionally distributed Studio Ghibli movies in Japan, GKIDS has tended to be the distributor for those same films in North America. Last year, GKIDS released Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” in theaters in North America, grossing $46 million domestically. It was one of GKIDS’ biggest hits ever. Combined with Toho’s international distribution, “The Boy and the Heron” totaled $173 million worldwide. And just a week later Toho had another hit on its hands with “Godzilla Minus One,” which grossed $115 million worldwide and also won an Oscar.

Stock market today: Dow jumps over 300 points to hit fresh record, lead stock rebound Read full article Karen Friar and Josh Schafer Updated Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 10:40 PM Link Copied 484 In this article: US stocks popped on Wednesday, rebounding toward record highs, as investors digested a barrage of earnings results highlighted by Morgan Stanley ( MS ). The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose nearly 350 points, or about 0.8%, to close at a record high of 43,077.70. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained nearly 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was up around 0.5% and closed just shy of its own record. All three major gauges rebounded after pulling back from all-time highs on Tuesday. ASML's ( ASML ) deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the artificial intelligence chip trade , driving down stocks like Nvidia ( NVDA ). Chip stocks rebounded Wednesday, led by a 3.1% bounce back from Nvidia. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell showed fresh signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. Profits jumped compared to last year, thanks to a rise in dealmaking that has also lifted its peers. Shares rose nearly 7% following the release. At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ), and luxury stalwart LVMH ( MC.PA , LVMUY ) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere. In commodities, gold ( GC=F ) rallied toward a record high as fresh tariff promises from Republican nominee Donald Trump added to uncertainty around the outcome of the tight US presidential race. LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 13 updates Wed, October 16, 2024 at 9:08 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Utilities and Financials extend 2024 lead Utilities ( XLU ) and Financials ( XLF ) led the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) on Wednesday, extending their lead among the sectors for the year. For the year, the Utilities sector, driven by enthusiasm surrounding interest rate cuts and energy demand to power AI servers, is up nearly 30% this year. Meanwhile, Financials, catching a recent bid off a swath of strong earnings from big banks , is up more than 26% now this year. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 8:45 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer A widespread stock market rally For a long time, the current bull market was defined as a few stocks driving the major averages higher. Not only is that no longer true, but we’re actually seeing one of the most widespread rallies to new all-time highs of the current rally. During Tuesday’s trading session over 20% of stocks in the S&P 500 traded at a 52-week high, while no stocks traded at a 52-week low, per Bespoke Investment Group. That marked the strongest net percentage of stocks hitting new 52-week highs in a single trading session since March 21. And omitting that one day in March, it was the highest since May 2021. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 8:18 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Oil could fall to $25 per barrel by 2050 if net zero emissions goals met, IEA says The world is on its way toward cheaper energy as clean technologies grow to meet growing electricity demand, leaving behind an oversupply of oil and gas , according to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Under its primary scenario, the IEA, which advocates for green technologies, predicts clean energy will meet "virtually all" growth in energy demand between 2023 and 2035, leading to a peak in demand for all three fossil fuels before 2030. That translates to oil import prices of about $79 per barrel in 2030, higher than where fossil fuel is currently trading. But under the scenario where the world achieves its net zero emissions and limits global warming, IEA sees oil prices falling to $25 per barrel by 2050. Read more here. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 7:45 PM GMT+1 Alexandra Canal Will another round of price hikes hit Netflix users? Netflix ( NFLX ) is set to report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday after market close — and analysts are looking ahead to another possible round of price hikes. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022 , upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan in October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering , introduced less than two years ago, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025," Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said in a note to clients. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte . Retaining loyal subscribers over time is a challenge due to consumers churning out of, or canceling, their subscription plans. Read more about what Wall Street expects from the streaming giant here. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 7:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Investors eye key retail sales report on Thursday The September retail sales report is slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Consensus expects sales rose 0.3% in the month, up from the 0.1% increase seen in August, per Bloomberg data. The data comes at a critical time in the economic narrative as a blowout September jobs report has sparked debate over if the US economy is actually cooling or starting to show signs of a reacceleration. Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau believes the report could show signs of the latter. "This week's September retail sales report should continue the run of hot data," Juneau wrote in a Monday note to clients. "Should our forecast prove correct, the narrative may shift further toward "no landing" or even re-acceleration." Importantly, though, Bank of America's equity strategy team doesn't believe markets beginning to price in a " no landing," where economic growth remains resilient or reaccelerates while inflation doesn't fall as rapidly to the Fed's 2% goal, would necessarily be bad for stocks. "'No landing' is bullish for stocks, in our view, as long as inflation doesn't flare up," Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. "In a contained inflation environment, the relationship between rates and stocks should be positive (i.e. good news is good news). The Fed cutting into an accelerating EPS environment suggests cyclicals should outperform defensives." Wed, October 16, 2024 at 6:15 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Novavax shares tank after vaccines for flu, COVID put on hold Novavax ( NVAX ) shares were down more than 17% on Wednesday after US regulators placed the company's experimental flu and COVID combination vaccines on hold. The moves comes after a study volunteer for the combination vaccine developed a serious nerve disorder. Read more here. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 5:40 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Utilities, Financials lead S&P 500 into positive territory Just after 12:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose more roughly 250 points, or 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was up 0.2%. Utilities ( XLU ) and Financials ( XLF ) led the action in the S&P 500, both rising more than 1%. Source: Yahoo Finance Wed, October 16, 2024 at 4:45 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Russell 2000 pacing for highest close since November 2021 The small-cap Russell 2000 ( ^RUT ) index is up more than 1.5% on Wednesday, far outpacing the gains of the three major indexes and closing in on its 52-week high of 2,300. If the Russell closes at its current levels, it will mark the highest close for the index since November 2021. Small caps have been one of the most highly debated trades on Wall Street in 2024. Given the sector's higher exposure to refinancing risk, strategists have argued that lower rates will benefit the group. That thesis, combined with evidence that the US economy continues to track for solid growth, has once again built the case for an allocation to small caps, according to Wall Street strategists. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently moved to a "neutral" on allocation to small versus large caps following the Federal Reserve's half-percentage-point interest rate cut in September. "For us to get outright bullish on Small caps overall, leading macro indicators would likely need to show that a clear acceleration in growth is coming," Wilson wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "For now, we're focused on idiosyncratic opportunities within the small cap space." He added, "Valuation is relatively cheap for small caps, while earnings are set to improve. To some extent, this has been the Small cap index mantra for nearly two years, but after consecutive years of earnings contraction, the consensus is more optimistic on earnings expansion ahead." Wed, October 16, 2024 at 4:02 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Airlines hit a 52-week high The US global Jets ETF ( JETS ) rose around 3% to hit a fresh 52-week high on Wednesday. The ETF's top holdings include major carriers such as United Airlines ( UAL ), Delta ( DAL ), American Airlines ( AAL ), and Southwest ( LUV ). The rally in airlines follows a better-than-expected earnings report from United after the bell on Tuesday. The carrier posted adjusted earnings of $3.33 per share for the third quarter, topping Wall Street's estimates for $3.07. United also announced a program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares. Its stock rose more than 9% in morning trade on Wednesday. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 3:14 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Amazon to explore nuclear development with Dominion Energy Amazon ( AMZN ) and Dominion Energy ( D ) said on Wednesday that they have signed an agreement to advance the development of nuclear Small Modular Reactors in Virginia. The partnership is part of Amazon Web Services' investment of over $500 million in nuclear power, CNBC reported . Amazon is the latest big tech company to explore nuclear energy to power its artificial intelligence plans. Both Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) have laid out nuclear strategies. Shares of Dominion Energy spiked more than 4% on the news. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 2:37 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Morgan Stanley stock jumps as its investment banking surges Morgan Stanley ( MS ) stock jumped 4% at the open after the company reported large year-over-year increases across a variety of metrics in its third quarter earnings release. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Fees from investment banking jumped 56% from a year ago, the largest leap among big banks, to nearly $1.4 billion. The pick-up in investment banking and an increase in trading helped Morgan Stanley push its net profit up by 32% from a year earlier, to $3.2 billion. The results cement a broad rebound across the Wall Street operations of the country's biggest banks. Investment banking fees and equity trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), Goldman Sachs ( GS ), Bank of America ( BAC ), and Citigroup ( C ). Read more here. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 2:34 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Stocks flat at the open US stocks were muted on Wednesday as investors digested results from Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML-fueled ( ASML ) slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ), the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) were all near flat at the open.

On Tuesday, the semiconductor market was downbeat following disappointing earnings from ASML, a Dutch company making the machines that make chips. By Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest chipmaker and one of ASML's biggest customers, had painted a different picture with its earnings : The AI-driven chip boom is far from over. The roller-coaster earnings can be explained by several factors. Chief among them is TSMC's and ASML's respective customers. ASML sells large lithography machines — which print circuit patterns onto silicon wafers — to chip manufacturers, including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. Advertisement The latter two companies have faced struggles of their own that are affecting the wider chip market. Intel, once the world's biggest chipmaker, has mounted a bid to turn its business around , including 15,000 layoffs. In early October, Samsung issued an apology for its poor financial performance. "Intel and Samsung are falling behind TSMC from a technological point of view," Javier Correonero, an equity analyst at Morningstar, told Business Insider. "This is just customer-specific problems as Intel and Samsung cannot ramp up new nodes properly, but this has nothing to do with demand." Meanwhile, TSMC is a competitor to Intel and Samsung. Its customers include Nvidia, the graphics-processing-unit designer spearheading the AI-chip boom, along with AMD and Qualcomm. This makes TSMC a good bellwether for AI-chip demand. Advertisement TSMC reported a 54% rise in third-quarter net profit to a record 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars, or about $10.1 billion. The forecast-beating results were driven by strong demand for AI despite lingering questions over the technology's return on investment . By contrast, ASML, Europe's most valuable tech company, slashed guidance for next year, sending its stock plunging by 16% in its biggest single-day drop since 1998. Other chip stocks followed , with Nvidia dipping almost 5%, AMD falling 5.3%, and Broadcom tumbling 3.5% about midday Tuesday. Their shares steadied on Wednesday. Another factor at play is that chipmakers increased their manufacturing capacity to meet rising demand during the pandemic. Now chipmakers such as Intel, Samsung, and TSMC have pulled back on ASML orders because they realize they have plenty of capacity, Dan Hutcheson, the vice chair at the analyst firm TechInsights, told Reuters. It's also key to distinguish that not all chips are for artificial intelligence — and weaker demand for other areas, like PCs, can drag growth. Advertisement "It is important to notice that semis have many subsegments, and while some subsegments can be in a bottom (like PCs), others can be on a top (AI), so it's difficult to predict where overall demand will be in 18 months," Correonero said. Demand for AI remains high In a conference call on Thursday, TSMC's chief executive, C.C. Wei, told investors that the company's growth was real and rejected the idea that AI was in a bubble. Related stories "This is a tangible ROI benefit," he said in response to a question from Gokul Hariharan, a JPMorgan analyst. "We cannot be the only one company that have benefited from this AI application. So I believe a lot of companies right now are using AI and further on improving productivity, efficiency, and everything." For now, investors seem to favor faster-growing companies like TSMC. Advertisement "It looks like TSMC seems to be in the better place for the time being, bolstered by its faster growth rate," Correonero said. "TSMC seems more aligned with Nvidia and others, where demand has held up much better in recent months and, indeed, shows signs of recovering after a mixed summer," he added. While a slowdown at ASML might suggest some caution, the bigger picture still points to a continued surge in AI demand. "In the short to medium term, AI applications, data centers, and advanced chips are still driving strong demand," Kate Leaman, the chief market analyst at AvaTrade , said. "So while ASML might be experiencing a temporary slowdown, companies like TSMC could continue delivering strong results thanks to these high-growth areas."

"For now," Leaman added, "the AI boom seems to be sustaining solid growth for chipmakers."

Ferrari Owner Upside Down $200,000 On Loan Wants To Trade His SF90 For A Corvette C8 Advertisement Read full article 32 Lawrence Hodge October 17, 2024 at 7:45 PM · 4 min read Image: Ferrari I’ve just come across what’s likely the worst car deal I’ve ever seen. The owner of a Ferrari SF90 supercar , $200,000 underwater , wants to trade it in for a $68,000, three-year old Corvette C8 . It’s a mess on both ends. The mind boggling deal comes to us by way of Tik Tok user Alex, aka @movingmerch , a car salesman with Earth Motor Cars in Carrollton, Texas. In a recent post, he’s shown speaking to a man by the name of Jason who owns a Ferrari SF90 (the owner was ok with being recorded) who wants to trade it in for something else. Why on earth would anyone want to get rid of a 986 horsepower hybrid supercar that’s able to hit 60 mph in less than three seconds and hit a top speed of 211 mph? Because he is totally screwed. tiktok-7425775329710558506 ADVERTISEMENT Jason explains he’s trying to get rid of the SF90 by trading it in for a 2021 Corvette C8 that Earth Motor Cars has listed for $68,762. He says that the payments on the SF90 are getting to be a bit much for him and he’s looking to get as close to his loan payoff amount as possible; or even the full pay off amount, which would be nearly impossible. He says he owes “a reasonable” amount on it. The amount is far from reasonable: Jason says he owes a little under $700,000, specifically $690,000 and some change. The look on Alex’s face says it all before he remarks “oh man.” It’s a massive amount to owe. Image: Ferrari Jason says he bought the car in 2021 for $770,000. For him to still owe nearly $700,000 over three years later tells us he probably got a really crappy APR. Alex says he has to be honest with him, that there’s no way he could get close to that amount for the car. He tells Jason the number he’s thinking of starts with a four, which Jason interprets as meaning that he’ll get $400,000 for the SF90. Alex clarifies that he means that he’ll give him over $400,000 for the car, a number Jason still doesn’t like. If you’re paying attention and doing the math, this means Jason has over $200,000 in negative equity on the SF90. He tells Alex that other dealers have been giving him similar numbers. He’s so screwed he says that he had to take out a loan to cover his rent. Story continues It seems he’s in the situation he’s in because of a job and income change. Jason says back when he purchased the SF90, he was making $30,000-$40,000 a month. Now he says his income is around $10,000 $15,000 a month though he doesn’t exactly say what the change was. He says he put no money down on the SF90 and his payments are $10,000-$11,000 a month. He remarks he should have never bought the car in the first place and he’s right. Even making $40,000 a month, that’s $480,000 annually, meaning the SF90’s purchase price was over 62 percent of his annual income. Alex explains to him the market for the SF90 and gives him examples of others he has seen going for under $500,000 and tells Jason he’s probably not the only person in this situation. Unfortunately there’s nothing that Alex can do to help him out of that $200,000 hole because he can’t roll that much negative equity onto another car like a C8. Alex then asks Jason why the Corvette and Jason’s answer is nearly as wild as this situation: he says he just wants another sports car to drive because he has to “keep a certain kind of image.” Image is the last thing this man should be worrying about. Alex says there really isn’t anything he can do to help him and says he’s got to call some friends who are more knowledgeable about situations like this. Before ending the call, Alex says the one thing he can do is a voluntary repossession of the SF90 rather than letting it get repoed, something Jason seems open to doing. Whatever Jason does regarding his SF90, this is a screwed up situation. It also goes to show that even those that you may think are doing better off than you are may be in a life altering, screwed up situation. For the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

The Only Way to Fix US Health Care | Adam Gaffney, David U. Himmelstein, Steffie Woolhandler | The New York Review of Books Advertisement Facebook Twitter Mail to Print page Submit a letter: Email us letters@nybooks.com Reviewed: We’ve Got You Covered: Rebooting American Health Care by Liran Einav and Amy Finkelstein Portfolio, 275 pp., $29.00 “We take it back,” Liran Einav and Amy Finkelstein, two of America’s most prominent health economists, declare in a new book, We’ve Got You Covered , their blueprint for reforming our health care system. After years of preaching “the gospel” that “patients must pay something for their care,” they’ve now abandoned the message. Instead they propose tax-funded “basic” health coverage—without copayments, deductibles, or other forms of “cost-sharing”—for all Americans. Almost simultaneously, three other leading health economists—Katherine Baicker, the provost of the University of Chicago, who served on George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Amitabh Chandra and Mark Shepard of Harvard—outlined a similar proposal in the Journal of Economic Perspectives . This may signal an encouraging shift in elite opinion, at least among economists, in the debate over health care reform. Einav and Finkelstein, professors at Stanford and MIT , respectively, spent years teaching that unless patients had skin in the game—that is, unless they had to shell out for each medical appointment—they would “rush to the doctor every time they sneeze,” siphoning resources from other, more beneficial uses. That line of thinking has been dogma among US economists, despite decades of evidence to the contrary in the form of successful single-payer systems in Europe and Canada with little or no such “cost-sharing,” and helps explain why (often hefty) copayments and deductibles have been central to US health insurance. Health insurance as we know it was pioneered during the Great Depression, when Baylor University Hospital offered coverage, without copays or deductibles, to financially strapped Dallas schoolteachers. This grew into a nationwide federation of nonprofit Blue Cross plans, which dominated the market for the next several decades and likewise avoided cost-sharing. But in the years after World War II, commercial insurance firms began selling lower-cost plans that incorporated cost-sharing in order to discourage frivolous use of care (and insurers’ money), much as car insurers imposed deductibles to deter policyholders from taking hammers to their windshields when they wanted dirty glass replaced. Economists call this behavior “moral hazard.” The budding field of health economics transformed this business contrivance into gospel. In 1968 an influential paper by Mark Pauly argued that when health care is free, people use it in excess. The following decade Harvard’s Martin Feldstein (who later chaired President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers) wrote that “American families are in general overinsured against health expenses” and that higher out-of-pocket medical costs “would increase welfare” for society. Soon after, a study called the RAND Health Insurance Experiment randomly assigned thousands of families to different insurance plans, some of which imposed cost-sharing and some of which provided free care. In a bombshell 1981 article in The New England Journal of Medicine , the authors reported that people who received free care used more of it. “Moral hazard” became a credo. (Only in 1986 did the RAND team report that cost-sharing curbed both needed and unneeded care in similar measure.) The consequences were dire. The Heritage Foundation promoted gimmicky “consumer-driven” plans combining sky-high deductibles with tax-advantaged savings accounts that would, they argued, transform patients into prudent consumers. Milton Friedman—the godfather of libertarian economics—pushed the idea to the extreme, recommending that Medicare and Medicaid be abolished and that “every US family unit [be required to] have a major medical insurance policy with a high deductible, say $20,000 a year or 30 percent of the unit’s income.” Most workers in the US once enjoyed first-dollar coverage (no copays or deductibles) for much of their care: in 1982, for instance, only 30 percent of private plans had a deductible for hospital stays. Today 90 percent of private sector workers with job-based individual coverage face a deductible that averages $1,735 a year. Some states have even sought waivers to increase out-of-pocket payments for impoverished Medicaid recipients. In 2015 Indiana, under Governor Mike Pence, announced that such payments could “preserve dignity among members receiving public assistance and provide them with ‘skin in the game.’” Yet reams of evidence confirmed what our patients (and physician colleagues) regard as common sense: copays and deductibles cause people to skip needed care and hence suffer poorer health, and even mortal consequences. Women with breast cancer whose employers shifted them to high-deductible plans wound up delaying diagnostic workups and chemotherapy. Modest prescription copays caused seniors to forgo lifesaving medications. And while copayments and deductibles discouraged care seeking, they didn’t constrain health care spending, which rose from $1,000 per person in 1980—equivalent to spending in other wealthy nations—to $13,493 in 2022, more than double the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. (And notably the life expectancy in the US, which was middle of the pack among high-income nations in 1980, lagged 5.8 years behind the average by 2021.) As “skin in the game” lost its cachet, the big insurers pivoted to other profit-maximizing strategies. For instance, many now focus on privatizing Medicare and Medicaid. Some employ doctors directly and use penalties and bonuses to motivate them to minimize expensive care. Those shifts—along with an ever-growing body of data on medical harms—have perhaps changed the intellectual climate for economists to one more tolerant of jettisoning cost-sharing. Advertisement However, if Einav and Finkelstein (like Baicker, Chandra, and Shepard) have finally gotten some important things right, they continue to miss the mark on others: they embrace a two-tiered medical system and ignore (or, in Baicker and colleagues’ case, advocate policies that would accelerate) the corporate takeover of health care. These are related issues. Treating medical care as a market commodity like microchips or microwaves supports the dual falsehoods that copays benefit society and that market-driven corporatization breeds efficiency and quality. After World War II many nations created national health insurance ( NHI ) or national health service ( NHS ) systems covering their entire populations. The UK’s NHS , for instance, enacted in 1946, provided nearly all care for free. The following year Saskatchewan, under Premier Tommy Douglas (voted the “Greatest Canadian” by CBC viewers in 2004), implemented universal hospital insurance. By 1971 this had been expanded to provide all Canadians with first-dollar coverage for both hospital care and regular doctors’ visits. (Additionally, Canada prohibits private insurers from selling plans that duplicate the public coverage, and doctors and hospitals from accepting most private payments, provisions that keep wealthy and poor Canadians in the same health care boat, bolstering political support for the single-payer system they call Medicare.) 1 It once seemed possible that the US would follow suit. As the UK and some Canadian provinces implemented their systems, the Truman administration proposed an American version of NHI . A campaign led by the American Medical Association—which employed a pioneering public relations firm that painted the NHI bill as a “communist” act—defeated Truman’s push, and employer-paid health insurance filled the void. It had spread during the war—when wage increases but not additional “fringe benefits” were banned—and burgeoned after the war when Congress codified, in 1954, favorable tax treatment of employer-paid benefits. By 1955 private plans covered 65 percent of Americans. Among the millions left out were the unemployed, the elderly, those in agricultural or domestic work, and those working for small employers that didn’t offer health benefits. The civil rights–era enactment of Medicare and Medicaid 2 trimmed the share of Americans without coverage from about 24 percent in 1963 to 11 percent by the late 1970s. But as the power of unions waned under President Reagan, private coverage shrank, and the number of uninsured Americans rose. By 1994 15.8 percent of Americans had no health coverage. The passage in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), which expanded Medicaid and offered new subsidies for private insurance, reversed the trend. Emergency pandemic-era measures—mainly liberalized Medicaid eligibility rules—cut the uninsurance rate to an all-time low of 7.4 percent in 2023. Even so, that meant 25 million Americans remained uninsured, a number that the Congressional Budget Office predicts will grow to 28.2 million next year. These stark figures still understate the precariousness of Americans’ health coverage. Einav and Finkelstein’s research has found that over a two-year period (prepandemic) more than one in five Americans spent at least one month uninsured. The briefest coverage lapses can cause financial ruin and interrupt lifesaving treatment. Under our patchwork public-private system, people lose coverage for many reasons. Some fail to file paperwork required to continue their Medicaid eligibility. Others fall off their parents’ coverage when they turn twenty-six. Or they lose a job or are unable to afford the premiums required by most private plans, including ACA plans. Many immigrants are barred from Medicaid and Medicare. Yet for five decades most US health economists have advised merely caulking the gaps. Obamacare, which was largely designed by MIT ’s Jonathan Gruber, is a prime example. The complex bureaucracy it erected to avoid displacing private insurers added an estimated quarter-trillion dollars between 2014 and 2022 to Americans’ already exorbitant outlays for health insurance administration. Einav and Finkelstein now rightly conclude that more patches won’t work; we have to start from scratch. “Basic coverage,” they write, “must be provided automatically, and financed by the taxpayer.” But their support for tax-funded universal coverage comes with a caveat: to be affordable, the public coverage “should be very basic”—worse than current coverage—with “longer wait times, less patient choice.” It should leave “patients and their physicians not at liberty to get any medical care they both want, as they are currently under Medicare.” But the very concept of “basic coverage” rests on economic and medical fallacies; there is no workable definition of the “basic” or “minimalist” care Einav and Finkelstein propose that would simultaneously slash spending and provide medically adequate care. There is useless care, to be clear, like ineffective drugs or unneeded surgeries. But ineffective treatments (such as the “energy boost” infusions our local urgent care center advertises) shouldn’t be approved by regulators or prescribed by physicians, regardless of costs. Advertisement In the realm of effective care, there is no circumscribable “basic” category that can be safely carved out of coverage. For patients with serious symptoms, long waits to see a specialist are often harmful. For those with uncommon cancers requiring complex surgeries, access to a top-level cancer center where such surgeries are routinely performed can be lifesaving. “Basic coverage” might also exclude expensive treatments deemed cost-ineffective, but many such treatments—like organ transplants or gene therapies for sickle cell disease—are also lifesaving. “Minimalist coverage,” in practice, means greater disability and shorter lives. Recognizing that the affluent wouldn’t abide “basic coverage,” Einav and Finkelstein (like Baicker et al.) would allow “top-up,” or supplemental, coverage in a higher tier. Of course, imposing long lines on working- and middle-class Americans while letting the rich jump the queue isn’t just inequitable; it’s medically hazardous. In the real world of finite health resources—with a limited number of physicians, nurses, PET scanners, and ICU beds—privileging the rich inevitably siphons resources away from everyone else. But a simpler, more efficient, healthier, and fairer alternative has long been available: universal single-tier coverage. Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Bernie Sanders have introduced Medicare for All bills delineating that approach. 3 Critics contend that this would be too expensive, drawing on moral hazard theory and the RAND experiment to argue that eliminating cost barriers would cause patients to overuse their health benefits. Yet the RAND experiment only assessed copayments’ effects on individual patients’ use of care, not society-wide effects, which may differ. In health care, supply often drives (or constrains) a society’s overall use of care. Doctors can fill openings in their schedule by advising more frequent return visits; conversely, they may avoid transferring borderline patients to the ICU when beds are tight. Milton Roemer described this phenomenon with the aphorism “A hospital bed built is a hospital bed filled.” Given limited supplies of doctors and hospital beds, cost-sharing that reduces one group’s use of services would likely increase it for those without cost barriers, redistributing care like toothpaste in a closed tube squeezed on one end. That’s not just a theory. John Wennberg’s pathbreaking analyses of regional variation in care linked the frequency of hospitalizations and operations to the local supply of beds and surgeons. Yet patients’ outcomes in high- and low-use regions were similar, suggesting that some hospitalizations and surgeries were unnecessary. We’ve found that the implementation of both Medicare and Obamacare increased physician visits for the newly covered, but those increases were fully offset by virtually imperceptible decreases for others. A similar phenomenon occurred in other nations when they expanded coverage. For instance, when Quebec implemented its universal health care program in 1970, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine reported that “physician visits per person per year remained constant at about five but were markedly shifted from persons in higher to lower income groups.” The economy of health care is singular. Care is constrained by a finite “supply,” while “demand” for care is unlike demand for most goods; patients want better health, not more colonoscopies or more trips to the operating room. And the types of care that improve health are determined not by consumers’ preferences but by their health needs—that is to say, by discoverable and objective medical facts. Scientific practice and supply planning can more safely and effectively constrain overuse than copays and two-tiered medicine. There is bad behavior, to be sure, but it’s not the behavior of patients with excessive demand; it’s corporate providers that raise costs and subvert care to benefit their bottom lines—a blind spot, as noted, in Einav and Finkelstein’s vision. They address one side of the policy coin—the question of who pays for health care—but neglect the equally important question of who owns it. Any workable prescription for reform must reckon with both. Profit seeking in medicine is not new. Pliny the Elder complained of physicians’ “avarice, their greedy bargains made with those whose fate lies in the balances.” In modern times commercial firms have dominated drug manufacture, and in the early twentieth century small proprietary nursing homes and hospitals were commonplace. But the contemporary takeover of health care provision and financing by mammoth investor-owned firms—what the late Arnold Relman, the New England Journal of Medicine editor-in-chief, described as the “medical-industrial complex” in an influential 1980 editorial 4 —is unprecedented. Beginning in the 1980s investor-owned hospital chains rapidly expanded; between 1980 and 2020 the share of US community hospitals that were for-profit doubled, reaching 24 percent. Meanwhile, among nonprofit hospitals, the advantage conferred by size in negotiating prices with insurers, and hospitals’ increasing reliance on borrowing (which must be paid back from operating profits) to finance construction and other capital needs, prompted both consolidation and the ascendancy of a corporate managerial ethos. The resulting sprawling nonprofit hospital systems that

Based in New York, Katherine graduated summa cum laude from Colgate University with a bachelor's degree in English literature. See full bio Katherine Watt Oct. 21, 2024 7:27 a.m. PT 6 min read Tharon Green/CNET The housing affordability crisis isn't just a minor talking point in this year's presidential election. It's a major economic problem for young voters like me. More than nine out of 10 Gen Zers say housing affordability is their top voting concern, outranking issues like education and abortion rights, according to a survey from Redfin. Although high mortgage rates , rising home prices and an undersupply of affordable houses affect homebuyers across all generations, an inaccessible housing market is a particularly acute question for my generation. Owning a home represents a path toward long-term financial stability and wealth . Yet for most of us, the prospect of homeownership feels like a long shot. "Gen Z is aging into their renting and early homebuying years at a time when housing is historically expensive," said Brittany Webb , director of research at the National Housing Conference. "That has made them painfully aware of the impact housing has on their lives." It's also led to apathy among younger generations, who watch economic headwinds come one after another. Homeownership can feel like an impossibility unless you have the benefit of generational wealth and guidance, said Webb. Today's housing market isn't the same one our parents and grandparents experienced. As Gen Zers enter their adult years, they're also dealing with high debt burdens, insecure employment and sluggish wage growth. Those factors are made worse by the increased cost of consumer goods and services, aka inflation. Many young voters are new to the workforce and spend the majority of their paychecks on rent, making it difficult to pay off student debt , much less save enough money to buy a house. More than half of adult Gen Zers say they can't afford to live the life they want, with the high cost of living making them financially dependent on others. Likewise, an increasing number of young adults are turning to live with family. According to recent census data, almost half of zoomers aged 18 to 29 still live with their parents , the highest level since the Great Depression. Ronald Carter, who works as a general contractor in Tacoma, Washington, told me he feels pressure to buy a house but can't even afford a starter home, which costs upward of $300,000. "I make good money but I'd need to be working 80-hour weeks to make that happen," said Carter. Like many others, Carter finds it challenging to afford monthly rent payments , which have increased by more than 30% since 2019, according to Zillow. Meanwhile, wages only grew 20% for the same period. "When I graduated high school, you could find a two-bedroom apartment for $1,000 to $1,500 a month," Carter said. Now, it's closer to $2,200 a month. Carter told me he and his peers have had to make difficult trade-offs to compensate. "You either pay rent and then your utilities or your phone gets turned off -- or you pay the utilities and phone bill so you're late on rent," said Carter. Many financial analysts would argue that the economy is robust. On paper, unemployment is relatively low, wages are increasing and inflation is cooling. Yet today's housing affordability crisis is a more accurate reflection of how younger generations view the economy. Because housing is typically our biggest monthly expense, it affects our ability to pay for anything else, including food and healthcare. When there's no room left in your budget each month, saving tens of thousands of dollars for a down payment feels insurmountable. What the presidential election means for housing affordability Housing affordability has long been a major issue in the US, particularly for the lowest-income Americans, but it rarely takes center stage in presidential elections. However, the surge in mortgage rates and home prices since the pandemic means the crisis is affecting a broader set of voters, particularly middle-class households. In recent months, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have proposed lowering housing costs. Both candidates have commented on the long-running housing supply shortage , which experts agree is a factor in today's housing affordability crisis. One reason home prices have increased so dramatically over the past few decades is that not enough houses are being built to keep up with demand. Expensive land and construction costs, as well as strict zoning and land-usage laws, limit where and what types of homes are built, said Doug McCoy , director of the Center on Real Estate Studies at Indiana University Kelley School of Business. "Housing affordability is a really important part of public policy and part of the American Dream, as well. But I think that's kind of gotten lost," McCoy said. Specifically, there's a critical lack of affordable housing being built in areas where people want to live, said Webb. "Even as we sought to increase housing production in recent years, we were not being intentional about building smaller, more affordable homes," she said. For her part, Harris said she promises to build 3 million new homes by offering a first-of-its-kind tax incentive for builders focused on first-time buyers, as well as extending existing incentives for affordable rental housing construction. On the demand side, Harris said she would provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. Trump, on the other hand, has said his controversial immigration policies (like mass deportations) will help the housing shortage . He also proposed increasing inventory by opening portions of federally owned land (something Harris has also suggested) for large-scale housing construction and reducing zoning and environmental regulations that restrict housing supply. Right now, both plans are merely campaign rhetoric. No president, regardless of who's elected, can change zoning laws, which are decided on the local and state levels. The federal government could, however, influence the direction of those policies via tax incentives or other funding. "It's not that addressing housing affordability is difficult. It's just that it hasn't been a priority," said McCoy. Crafting, strengthening and implementing effective housing policies won't happen overnight, particularly with a divided Congress. "It took us a long time to get here and it will take us a long time to get out," said Webb. Homebuying advice for Gen Zers, from Gen Zers Plenty of us still want to ride what's considered to be America's wealth escalator: establishing financial security and generational wealth through home equity . But over the last roughly three decades, the median wealth gap between homeowners and renters has increased by 70%. If housing doesn't become more affordable, that gap will only widen. Young voters' pessimism about the housing market can be attributed to multiple economic factors, including inflation, debt and high interest rates. The lack of affordable housing affects our day-to-day lives and our future goals, like being able to build a family and retire. Caroline Coladonato , a Gen Zer and real estate agent at Tri-County Suburban Realtors in Pennsylvania, moved back in with her parents to save money for a home purchase. "One of the main reasons I want to buy a home is because it's part of the American Dream," she said. Coladonato said having a better understanding of the homebuying process makes her feel more confident about her prospects. "Part of that comes from my industry experience. I know what programs and resources are available for homebuyers, especially for first-time buyers ," she said. Many of us never learned about homebuying or housing market fundamentals, let alone basic personal finance, in school. Similar to Coladonato, if I didn't cover the housing market and mortgage rates for a living, I'd probably feel a lot worse about being able to afford an eventual home purchase. At the end of the day, how the next administration addresses (or doesn't address) housing affordability isn't within our control. Neither are mortgage rates or home prices. But the more we learn about the process of buying a home and how mortgages work, the better off we'll be. "That's not to say it isn't a tricky market. It is. But I think when you see the steps for yourself, and know that it is possible, you now have a tangible goal to reach toward," said Coladonato. So, I wrote a guide to help me (and you) make that dream of homeownership a reality.

Hong Kong Optimism, China’s “There Is No Alternative” (TINA) Moment Brendan Ahern Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Oct 16, 2024, 10:40am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Key News Asian equities were largely lower, as Taiwan underperformed following ASML’s earnings miss yesterday, while Thailand and Indonesia managed to outperform. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room throughout the day, despite US-listed China stocks being down significantly yesterday. The recent correction, following the massive stimulus-driven rally, paused on light volumes. Local investors are contemplating tomorrow’s 10 am press conference and Q&A to be held by multiple authorities, including the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Natural Resources, and the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank. Leaders will discuss “the relevant situation of promoting the stable and healthy development of the real estate market”. Not surprisingly, Real Estate was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, where it was up +4.4%, and in Mainland China, where it was up 4.72%, though, within MSCI indices, there are just 6 Hong Kong real estate stocks and only 7 in Mainland China. That explains why I like the tasty yields on US dollar-denominated high-yield real estate bonds as a rebound play, though everyone keeps buying US high-yield and ignoring me. Chengdu is pushing through a big real estate and infrastructure development plan, while Mainland media noted that second-tier Chinese cities, including Nanjing and Chengdu, saw strong home buying during Golden Week. There was a massive disparity between Hong Kong-listed stocks today and US-listed China stocks (ADRs) yesterday, which is leading to a bounce today. Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value were Tencent, down -0.29% versus its non-sponsored ADR which was down -4.91%, Meituan, up +1.41% versus its non-sponsored ADR which fell -5.42%, Alibaba, down -0.9% versus its ADR which fell -5.54%, and JD.com which fell -3.12% versus its ADR which fell -9.02%. That explains why we hold the stocks in Hong Kong and not the US! Other names were Kuaishou, down -2.32% versus its ADR which fell -20.58% (the ADR basically doesn’t trade as a FYI), Trip.com, down -1.89% versus its ADR which fell -8.83%, Li Auto, down -0.61% versus its ADR which fell -5.54%, Baidu, down -0.97% versus its ADR which fell -5.19%, and Bilibili, up +1.14% versus its ADR which fell -6.92%. LVMH’s miss was cited as weighing on consumer plays. Southbound Stock Connect was a rare net sell today though Alibaba was back to being a net buy following yesterday’s first net sell day. ASML weighed on technology stocks in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, down -1.02% and -2.76%. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor China isn’t going anywhere geographically or economically, though we are in a bit of a TINA (there is no alternative for the government’s stimulus, housing prices, and getting investors back into the stock market. How do you let Shanghai and Shenzhen fall after telling local citizens to buy? I don’t think you can. My recommendation: think about what’s coming down the road ahead through the windshield and not looking in the rear-view mirror. Reuters had a great indicator of how far along we are in the China equity rally. Reuters interviewed former CIO of the $347 billion California State Teachers Retirement System (CALSTERS), Christopher Ailman, who is the Chairman of the North American chapter of the 300 Club, a group of US and European pension and asset managers. In a recent 300 Club meeting, named ironically for the 300 Spartans who fought the Persians at Thermopylae back in 480 BC. Ailman said that "Money managers on the call agreed that the prices of certain Chinese stocks looked attractive from the technical and fundamental perspectives, but no one indicated they were increasing their Chinese investments. " He added that, despite this, " No one wants to go rushing in before the U.S. election ." Which China stocks in particular do investors find attractive? C’mon, it ain’t banks, energy, materials, or industrials that look attractive! I think it has to be the the "good stuff", i.e., the growth names, which are predominantly listed in Hong Kong! Have any of the 300 Club members bought the rally? Leonidas would be disappointed! The election? What are you afraid of? Trump wins? Do you really think 60% tariffs could be economic reality versus nothing more than campaign rhetoric? In fact, Trump said explicitly in an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago that tariffs are meant to get foreign companies to set up shop in the US and extract other concessions, not as a long-term policy! Shouldn’t you be shorting Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Home Depot if you believe 60% tariffs are coming because those companies are cooked without China? Ailman also validated our thesis about the geographic rewind back into China, stating, “U.S. and Canadian funds were particularly "gun shy" about investing in China right now,” i.e., they will likely be the last ones back in. The first will be the Chinese buying of China, which is occurring based on the Southbound Stock flows from China into Hong Kong and the massive buybacks from the tech entrepreneur-founded internet companies. Next will be Asian investors likely taking a little profit from their historical overweight to US tech stocks, Japan, and India, and using that capital to dip their toes back into cheap China consumer, internet, and technology names. This morning, Bank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey noted that, “Global fund managers increased their allocation to China at India’s expense after Asia’s largest economy unleashed a stimulus package.” India’s average P/E is 24 versus China’s 11. This stunning valuation disparity was a factor as well, though it doesn’t mention India’s massive retail-driven stock option enthusiasm. At the end of the day, big strategic institutional rebalancing to rectify China's underweights has not started yet or, at least, it is in the very early stages. Privately held Xiao Hong Shu, which translates as "Little Red Book" and is often thought of as China’s Instagram, had a leak. The company did not release financial data, though it appears that it landed in the hands of some journalists and investors, likely due to preparation efforts, and security breaches, leading up to a potential IPO. More likely to come on this! The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -0.16% and -1.09%, respectively, on volume that decreased -20.25% from yesterday, which is 176% of the 1-year average. 278 stocks advanced, while 212 declined. Main Board short turnover, which decreased by -40.18% from Thursday, which is 112% of the 1-year average, as 10% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, which was up +4.39%, Materials, up +3.08%, and Financials, up +1.01%. Meanwhile, Consumer Staples fell -1.61%, Information Technology fell -1.03%, and Health Care fell -0.92%. The top-performing subsectors were food & beverage, real estate services, and media. Meanwhile, consumer services, consumer durables were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were high, 2X normal, as Mainland investors sold a net -$198 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a small net buy, and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, which was a large net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board diverged to close +0.05%, -0.45%, and -2.57%, respectively, on volume that was down -15.84% from yesterday, which is 165% of the 1-year average. 2,154 stocks advanced, while 2,762 declined. The value factor and small capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, up 4.72%, Financials, up +1.37%, and Communication Services, up +1.01%, while Technology fell -2.76%, Healthcare fell -1.88%, and Consumer Discretionary fell -1.71%. The top-performing subsectors were real estate, water, and precious metals. Meanwhile, diversified financials, computer hardware, and semiconductors were among the worst-performing. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were high, at just over 2X the average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index gained versus the US dollar. The Treasury bond curve flattened. Copper and steel fell.

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Oct 17, 2024, 11:35am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Key News Asian equities were mixed overnight, though the most significant event was Taiwan Semiconductor's blowout earnings beat after the close. Every couple has stated to their spouse at one point, “I do everything!” concerning the division of labor/chores. The top echelon of the Chinese government must feel that way as yet another government agency press conference failed to meet expectations that might have been too high, leaving investors underwhelmed and disappointed. The full notes are below, but the only meaningful data is that 1 million homes will be renovated, loan amounts dedicated to the “white list,” real estate projects deemed too big to fail/too important to fail, will be doubled from the current amount of RMB 2.23 trillion by year-end and specifically mentioned support for housing support for families with two or more children. Also reiterated was the RMB 150B returned to households through the 0.5% mortgage refinancing. The Hang Seng, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were up +2.45%, +1.21%, and +1.59% in morning trading, but fell as it was clear further details on housing support weren’t coming as markets rolled over in afternoon trading to close near intra-day lows. Based on the light volumes, small pullback, and lack of significant selling, markets have realized that implementation details won’t come until the upcoming NPC meeting. Rumors that the NPC will be delayed until after the US election make no sense to me as the domestic economy needs attention, also a delay could be viewed as a sign of weakness. A Mainland media article noted that the market’s recent pullback provides investors with a good entry point, insinuating that more good news is coming based on the “unprecedented” policy coordination amongst government agencies—no real reason to panic, as we just need to be patient. Real estate was the worst-performing sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, as traders took profits though distress developer Suanc fell -27% after issuing 489 million new shares on the stock’s rebound. That is good for bondholders, though not so much for stockholders. Mainland investors bought the Hong Kong dip with a healthy $1.075B of net buying of Hong Kong stocks today with Alibaba, Xiaomi, and Tencent net buys. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Baidu reported that its founder and CEO, Robin Li, participated in Harvard Business Review’s Future of Business 2024 virtual conference, stating we are “currently witnessing an “inevitable” bubble in the AI sector, similar to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.” First movers like Baidu with its ERNIE Bot are apt to be the winners. He compared today’s AI revolution to “the industrial revolution for inspiration where a lot of old jobs were displaced, but even more new jobs were created.” I’ll have to check out the full video! It is worth noting that two pandas arrived from China in Washington, DC, on their way to the zoo via a FedEx plane. Panda diplomacy is a small positive despite the economically detached from reality campaign rhetoric. Full notes from today’s press conference Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Department: renovate 1mm urban/village homes, RMB 4 trillion dedicated to “white list”/real estate projects deemed too big to fail/too necessary to fail, home buying picking up, support families with two or more children, protection homebuyers during liquidation/bankruptcy of real estate projects Ministry of Finance: local governments will utilize special bonds for affordable housing, adjust VAT regarding real estate Ministry of Natural Resources: proceeds of special bonds used to buy projects and land PBOC: mortgage refinancing by 0.5% will save RMB 150B, which will benefit 50mm households and 150mm residents; refinancing will be completed by 10/26 State Administration for Financial Regulation: thus far, RMB 2.23 trillion of loans have been dedicated to the “white list,” though that will double by year-end to over RMB 4 trillion, optimize loan allocation The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -1.02% and -1.19%, respectively, on volume that declined -8% from yesterday, which is 161% of the 1-year average. 90 stocks advanced, while 403 stocks declined.

Technology was the only positive sector, up +0.64%, while Real Estate fell -7.84%, Materials fell -2.1%, and Energy fell -1.82%, to make up the worst-performing sectors.

Stock market today: Dow jumps over 300 points to hit fresh record, lead stock rebound Read full article Karen Friar and Josh Schafer Updated Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 10:40 PM Link Copied 484 In this article: US stocks popped on Wednesday, rebounding toward record highs, as investors digested a barrage of earnings results highlighted by Morgan Stanley ( MS ). The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose nearly 350 points, or about 0.8%, to close at a record high of 43,077.70. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained nearly 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was up around 0.5% and closed just shy of its own record. All three major gauges rebounded after pulling back from all-time highs on Tuesday. ASML's ( ASML ) deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the artificial intelligence chip trade , driving down stocks like Nvidia ( NVDA ). Chip stocks rebounded Wednesday, led by a 3.1% bounce back from Nvidia. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell showed fresh signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. Profits jumped compared to last year, thanks to a rise in dealmaking that has also lifted its peers. Shares rose nearly 7% following the release. At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ), and luxury stalwart LVMH ( MC.PA , LVMUY ) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere. In commodities, gold ( GC=F ) rallied toward a record high as fresh tariff promises from Republican nominee Donald Trump added to uncertainty around the outcome of the tight US presidential race. LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 13 updates Wed, October 16, 2024 at 9:08 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Utilities and Financials extend 2024 lead Utilities ( XLU ) and Financials ( XLF ) led the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) on Wednesday, extending their lead among the sectors for the year. For the year, the Utilities sector, driven by enthusiasm surrounding interest rate cuts and energy demand to power AI servers, is up nearly 30% this year.

Not only is that no longer true, but we’re actually seeing one of the most widespread rallies to new all-time highs of the current rally. During Tuesday’s trading session over 20% of stocks in the S&P 500 traded at a 52-week high, while no stocks traded at a 52-week low, per Bespoke Investment Group. That marked the strongest net percentage of stocks hitting new 52-week highs in a single trading session since March 21. And omitting that one day in March, it was the highest since May 2021. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 8:18 PM GMT+1 Ines Ferré Oil could fall to $25 per barrel by 2050 if net zero emissions goals met, IEA says The world is on its way toward cheaper energy as clean technologies grow to meet growing electricity demand, leaving behind an oversupply of oil and gas , according to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Under its primary scenario, the IEA, which advocates for green technologies, predicts clean energy will meet "virtually all" growth in energy demand between 2023 and 2035, leading to a peak in demand for all three fossil fuels before 2030. That translates to oil import prices of about $79 per barrel in 2030, higher than where fossil fuel is currently trading. But under the scenario where the world achieves its net zero emissions and limits global warming, IEA sees oil prices falling to $25 per barrel by 2050. Read more here.

Netflix ( NFLX ) is set to report its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday after market close — and analysts are looking ahead to another possible round of price hikes. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022 , upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan in October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering , introduced less than two years ago, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025," Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said in a note to clients. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte . Retaining loyal subscribers over time is a challenge due to consumers churning out of, or canceling, their subscription plans. Read more about what Wall Street expects from the streaming giant here. Wed, October 16, 2024 at 7:00 PM GMT+1 Josh Schafer Investors eye key retail sales report on Thursday The September retail sales report is slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Consensus expects sales rose 0.3% in the month, up from the 0.1% increase seen in August, per Bloomberg data. The data comes at a critical time in the economic narrative as a blowout September jobs report has sparked debate over if the US economy is actually cooling or starting to show signs of a reacceleration. Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau believes the report could show signs of the latter. "This week's September retail sales report should continue the run of hot data," Juneau wrote in a Monday note to clients. "Should our forecast prove correct, the narrative may shift further toward "no landing" or even re-acceleration." Importantly, though, Bank of America's equity strategy team doesn't believe markets beginning to price in a " no landing," where economic growth remains resilient or reaccelerates while inflation doesn't fall as rapidly to the Fed's 2% goal, would necessarily be bad for stocks. "'No landing' is bullish for stocks, in our view, as long as inflation doesn't flare up," Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. "In a contained inflation environment, the relationship between rates and stocks should be positive (i.e. good news is good news). The Fed cutting into an accelerating EPS environment suggests cyclicals should outperform defensives."

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) was up 0.2%.

If the Russell closes at its current levels, it will mark the highest close for the index since November 2021. Small caps have been one of the most highly debated trades on Wall Street in 2024. Given the sector's higher exposure to refinancing risk, strategists have argued that lower rates will benefit the group. That thesis, combined with evidence that the US economy continues to track for solid growth, has once again built the case for an allocation to small caps, according to Wall Street strategists. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently moved to a "neutral" on allocation to small versus large caps following the Federal Reserve's half-percentage-point interest rate cut in September. "For us to get outright bullish on Small caps overall, leading macro indicators would likely need to show that a clear acceleration in growth is coming," Wilson wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "For now, we're focused on idiosyncratic opportunities within the small cap space." He added, "Valuation is relatively cheap for small caps, while earnings are set to improve. To some extent, this has been the Small cap index mantra for nearly two years, but after consecutive years of earnings contraction, the consensus is more optimistic on earnings expansion ahead."

Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Fees from investment banking jumped 56% from a year ago, the largest leap among big banks, to nearly $1.4 billion. The pick-up in investment banking and an increase in trading helped Morgan Stanley push its net profit up by 32% from a year earlier, to $3.2 billion.

In a recent post, he’s shown speaking to a man by the name of Jason who owns a Ferrari SF90 (the owner was ok with being recorded) who wants to trade it in for something else. Why on earth would anyone want to get rid of a 986 horsepower hybrid supercar that’s able to hit 60 mph in less than three seconds and hit a top speed of 211 mph? Because he is totally screwed.

He says that the payments on the SF90 are getting to be a bit much for him and he’s looking to get as close to his loan payoff amount as possible; or even the full pay off amount, which would be nearly impossible. He says he owes “a reasonable” amount on it. The amount is far from reasonable: Jason says he owes a little under $700,000 , specifically $690,000 and some change. The look on Alex’s face says it all before he remarks “oh man.” It’s a massive amount to owe. Advertisement Image : Ferrari Jason says he bought the car in 2021 for $770,000. For him to still owe nearly $700,000 over three years later tells us he probably got a really crappy APR. Alex says he has to be honest with him, that there’s no way he could get close to that amount for the car. He tells Jason the number he’s thinking of starts with a four, which Jason interprets as meaning that he’ll get $400,000 for the SF90. Alex clarifies that he means that he’ll give him over $400,000 for the car, a number Jason still doesn’t like. If you’re paying attention and doing the math, this means Jason has over $200,000 in negative equity on the SF90. He tells Alex that other dealers have been giving him similar numbers. He’s so screwed he says that he had to take out a loan to cover his rent. Advertisement It seems he’s in the situation he’s in because of a job and income change. Jason says back when he purchased the SF90, he was making $30,000-$40,000 a month. Now he says his income is around $10,000 $15,000 a month though he doesn’t exactly say what the change was. He says he put no money down on the SF90 and his payments are $10,000-$11,000 a month. He remarks he should have never bought the car in the first place and he’s right. Even making $40,000 a month, that’s $480,000 annually, meaning the SF90’s purchase price was over 62 percent of his annual income. Alex explains to him the market for the SF90 and gives him examples of others he has seen going for under $500,000 and tells Jason he’s probably not the only person in this situation. Unfortunately there’s nothing that Alex can do to help him out of that $200,000 hole because he can’t roll that much negative equity onto another car like a C8. Alex then asks Jason why the Corvette and Jason’s answer is nearly as wild as this situation: he says he just wants another sports car to drive because he has to “keep a certain kind of image.” Image is the last thing this man should be worrying about. Advertisement Alex says there really isn’t anything he can do to help him and says he’s got to call some friends who are more knowledgeable about situations like this. Before ending the call, Alex says the one thing he can do is a voluntary repossession of the SF90 rather than letting it get repoed, something Jason seems open to doing. Whatever Jason does regarding his SF90, this is a screwed up situation. It also goes to show that even those that you may think are doing better off than you are may be in a life altering, screwed up situation. Show all 131 comments Continue reading

Lower Rates, Surging Stock Market Fail To Ignite US IPO Market | IBTimes Business The beginning of a rate easing cycle by the Federal Reserve was expected to spur IPO activity but analysts see the market response as muted AFP Public listings on Wall Street have seen a slow comeback in 2024 despite a resilient US economy, a long-awaited interest rate cut by the central bank and stock valuations hitting record highs. Experts say the lackluster IPO activity is due to competition from venture capitalists and a rate cut that was slow to come. While initial public offerings (IPOs) typically pick up in the fall, the market was "more muted than anticipated" this year, said research group Renaissance Capital. The IPO market's "slow rebound" continued in the third quarter this year, the group added, as investors look towards 2025. Even though IPOs jumped nearly 30 percent from a year ago during the first nine months of 2024, the surge came from a low base of comparison, said Mark Roberts, managing partner at The Blueshirt Group. The fall of 2023 looked like a potential turning point for the market -- with British chip designer Arm, online marketing platform Klaviyo and German footwear brand Birkenstock all going public in a matter of weeks. But the fledgling trend was short-lived. The lower level of activity has endured although the world's biggest economy has proven resilient and so far avoided slipping into a recession. "Even more important than the state of the economy, with the stock market at record highs, you would expect a lot more IPO activity," said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who focuses on public listings. The beginning of a rate easing cycle by the Federal Reserve, which announced the first rate cut on September 18, was also expected to spur IPO activity. But Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, said the cut came too late and few were able to seize the opportunity. Some deals did come through, the most notable of them being jet engine maintenance company StandardAero. It raised over $1 billion in early October. Others chose to stay on the sidelines or pull back, with aluminum recycler Novelis scrapping its IPO plans altogether, citing "current market conditions." Roberts of The Blueshirt Group said the private sector is "significantly more upbeat" than a year ago and he expects more IPO activity in 2025. Experts say companies are not rushing to IPO because they can get funding elsewhere. A public listing is an arduous and lengthy process which requires companies to disclose a lot of information on their financials, operations and strategy, whereas a funding round limits the sharing to a handful of investors. "There's so much private equity and venture capital dry powder, so much money available for them to be investing that they're willing to pay high prices," said Ritter. In early July, private equity companies and venture capital funds held a record $2.6 trillion of uncommitted capital, looking for investment opportunities in unlisted stocks. Generative artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI had no trouble raising $6.6 billion in its latest funding round in early October, a tally that would have been the 12th biggest US IPO ever had they chosen to list on Wall Street. "You can understand why they feel no desire to go public in that kind of environment," Ritter added. "It wouldn't necessarily make sense for them to file for an IPO." In the past, existing shareholders might have pressured businesses to go public. However, founders, employees or venture capitalists are now able to monetize shares more easily than a few years ago, thanks to startup platforms catered to unlisted companies. Forge Global and Hiive are some of the options available -- as well as Nasdaq Private Market, run by Nasdaq, which also owns one of two main US stock exchanges.

On Tuesday, the semiconductor market was downbeat following disappointing earnings from ASML, a Dutch company making the machines that make chips. By Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest chipmaker and one of ASML's biggest customers, had painted a different picture with its earnings : The AI-driven chip boom is far from over. The roller-coaster earnings can be explained by several factors. Chief among them is TSMC's and ASML's respective customers. ASML sells large lithography machines — which print circuit patterns onto silicon wafers — to chip manufacturers, including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. Advertisement The latter two companies have faced struggles of their own that are affecting the wider chip market. Intel, once the world's biggest chipmaker, has mounted a bid to turn its business around , including 15,000 layoffs. In early October, Samsung issued an apology for its poor financial performance. "Intel and Samsung are falling behind TSMC from a technological point of view," Javier Correonero, an equity analyst at Morningstar, told Business Insider. "This is just customer-specific problems as Intel and Samsung cannot ramp up new nodes properly, but this has nothing to do with demand." Meanwhile, TSMC is a competitor to Intel and Samsung. Its customers include Nvidia, the graphics-processing-unit designer spearheading the AI-chip boom, along with AMD and Qualcomm. This makes TSMC a good bellwether for AI-chip demand. Advertisement TSMC reported a 54% rise in third-quarter net profit to a record 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars, or about $10.1 billion. The forecast-beating results were driven by strong demand for AI despite lingering questions over the technology's return on investment . By contrast, ASML, Europe's most valuable tech company, slashed guidance for next year, sending its stock plunging by 16% in its biggest single-day drop since 1998. Other chip stocks followed , with Nvidia dipping almost 5%, AMD falling 5.3%, and Broadcom tumbling 3.5% about midday Tuesday. Their shares steadied on Wednesday. Another factor at play is that chipmakers increased their manufacturing capacity to meet rising demand during the pandemic. Now chipmakers such as Intel, Samsung, and TSMC have pulled back on ASML orders because they realize they have plenty of capacity, Dan Hutcheson, the vice chair at the analyst firm TechInsights, told Reuters. It's also key to distinguish that not all chips are for artificial intelligence — and weaker demand for other areas, like PCs, can drag growth. Advertisement "It is important to notice that semis have many subsegments, and while some subsegments can be in a bottom (like PCs), others can be on a top (AI), so it's difficult to predict where overall demand will be in 18 months," Correonero said. Demand for AI remains high In a conference call on Thursday, TSMC's chief executive, C.C. Wei, told investors that the company's growth was real and rejected the idea that AI was in a bubble. Related stories "This is a tangible ROI benefit," he said in response to a question from Gokul Hariharan, a JPMorgan analyst. "We cannot be the only one company that have benefited from this AI application. So I believe a lot of companies right now are using AI and further on improving productivity, efficiency, and everything." For now, investors seem to favor faster-growing companies like TSMC. Advertisement "It looks like TSMC seems to be in the better place for the time being, bolstered by its faster growth rate," Correonero said. "TSMC seems more aligned with Nvidia and others, where demand has held up much better in recent months and, indeed, shows signs of recovering after a mixed summer," he added. While a slowdown at ASML might suggest some caution, the bigger picture still points to a continued surge in AI demand. "In the short to medium term, AI applications, data centers, and advanced chips are still driving strong demand," Kate Leaman, the chief market analyst at AvaTrade , said. "So while ASML might be experiencing a temporary slowdown, companies like TSMC could continue delivering strong results thanks to these high-growth areas." Advertisement As other chip firms, such as Qualcomm and Intel, publish earnings in the coming weeks, a clearer picture of the market will emerge. "For now," Leaman added, "the AI boom seems to be sustaining solid growth for chipmakers."

Ferrari Owner Upside Down $200,000 On Loan Wants To Trade His SF90 For A Corvette C8 Advertisement Read full article 32 Lawrence Hodge October 17, 2024 at 7:45 PM · 4 min read Image: Ferrari I’ve just come across what’s likely the worst car deal I’ve ever seen. The owner of a Ferrari SF90 supercar , $200,000 underwater , wants to trade it in for a $68,000, three-year old Corvette C8 . It’s a mess on both ends. The mind boggling deal comes to us by way of Tik Tok user Alex, aka @movingmerch , a car salesman with Earth Motor Cars in Carrollton, Texas. In a recent post, he’s shown speaking to a man by the name of Jason who owns a Ferrari SF90 (the owner was ok with being recorded) who wants to trade it in for something else. Why on earth would anyone want to get rid of a 986 horsepower hybrid supercar that’s able to hit 60 mph in less than three seconds and hit a top speed of 211 mph? Because he is totally screwed. tiktok-7425775329710558506 ADVERTISEMENT Jason explains he’s trying to get rid of the SF90 by trading it in for a 2021 Corvette C8 that Earth Motor Cars has listed for $68,762. He says that the payments on the SF90 are getting to be a bit much for him and he’s looking to get as close to his loan payoff amount as possible; or even the full pay off amount, which would be nearly impossible. He says he owes “a reasonable” amount on it. The amount is far from reasonable: Jason says he owes a little under $700,000, specifically $690,000 and some change. The look on Alex’s face says it all before he remarks “oh man.” It’s a massive amount to owe. Image: Ferrari Jason says he bought the car in 2021 for $770,000. For him to still owe nearly $700,000 over three years later tells us he probably got a really crappy APR. Alex says he has to be honest with him, that there’s no way he could get close to that amount for the car. He tells Jason the number he’s thinking of starts with a four, which Jason interprets as meaning that he’ll get $400,000 for the SF90. Alex clarifies that he means that he’ll give him over $400,000 for the car, a number Jason still doesn’t like. If you’re paying attention and doing the math, this means Jason has over $200,000 in negative equity on the SF90. He tells Alex that other dealers have been giving him similar numbers. He’s so screwed he says that he had to take out a loan to cover his rent. Story continues It seems he’s in the situation he’s in because of a job and income change. Jason says back when he purchased the SF90, he was making $30,000-$40,000 a month. Now he says his income is around $10,000 $15,000 a month though he doesn’t exactly say what the change was. He says he put no money down on the SF90 and his payments are $10,000-$11,000 a month. He remarks he should have never bought the car in the first place and he’s right. Even making $40,000 a month, that’s $480,000 annually, meaning the SF90’s purchase price was over 62 percent of his annual income. Alex explains to him the market for the SF90 and gives him examples of others he has seen going for under $500,000 and tells Jason he’s probably not the only person in this situation. Unfortunately there’s nothing that Alex can do to help him out of that $200,000 hole because he can’t roll that much negative equity onto another car like a C8. Alex then asks Jason why the Corvette and Jason’s answer is nearly as wild as this situation: he says he just wants another sports car to drive because he has to “keep a certain kind of image.” Image is the last thing this man should be worrying about. Alex says there really isn’t anything he can do to help him and says he’s got to call some friends who are more knowledgeable about situations like this. Before ending the call, Alex says the one thing he can do is a voluntary repossession of the SF90 rather than letting it get repoed, something Jason seems open to doing. Whatever Jason does regarding his SF90, this is a screwed up situation. It also goes to show that even those that you may think are doing better off than you are may be in a life altering, screwed up situation. For the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

The Only Way to Fix US Health Care | Adam Gaffney, David U. Himmelstein, Steffie Woolhandler | The New York Review of Books Advertisement Facebook Twitter Mail to Print page Submit a letter: Email us letters@nybooks.com Reviewed: We’ve Got You Covered: Rebooting American Health Care by Liran Einav and Amy Finkelstein Portfolio, 275 pp., $29.00 “We take it back,” Liran Einav and Amy Finkelstein, two of America’s most prominent health economists, declare in a new book, We’ve Got You Covered , their blueprint for reforming our health care system. After years of preaching “the gospel” that “patients must pay something for their care,” they’ve now abandoned the message. Instead they propose tax-funded “basic” health coverage—without copayments, deductibles, or other forms of “cost-sharing”—for all Americans. Almost simultaneously, three other leading health economists—Katherine Baicker, the provost of the University of Chicago, who served on George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Amitabh Chandra and Mark Shepard of Harvard—outlined a similar proposal in the Journal of Economic Perspectives . This may signal an encouraging shift in elite opinion, at least among economists, in the debate over health care reform. Einav and Finkelstein, professors at Stanford and MIT , respectively, spent years teaching that unless patients had skin in the game—that is, unless they had to shell out for each medical appointment—they would “rush to the doctor every time they sneeze,” siphoning resources from other, more beneficial uses. That line of thinking has been dogma among US economists, despite decades of evidence to the contrary in the form of successful single-payer systems in Europe and Canada with little or no such “cost-sharing,” and helps explain why (often hefty) copayments and deductibles have been central to US health insurance. Health insurance as we know it was pioneered during the Great Depression, when Baylor University Hospital offered coverage, without copays or deductibles, to financially strapped Dallas schoolteachers. This grew into a nationwide federation of nonprofit Blue Cross plans, which dominated the market for the next several decades and likewise avoided cost-sharing. But in the years after World War II, commercial insurance firms began selling lower-cost plans that incorporated cost-sharing in order to discourage frivolous use of care (and insurers’ money), much as car insurers imposed deductibles to deter policyholders from taking hammers to their windshields when they wanted dirty glass replaced. Economists call this behavior “moral hazard.” The budding field of health economics transformed this business contrivance into gospel. In 1968 an influential paper by Mark Pauly argued that when health care is free, people use it in excess. The following decade Harvard’s Martin Feldstein (who later chaired President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers) wrote that “American families are in general overinsured against health expenses” and that higher out-of-pocket medical costs “would increase welfare” for society. Soon after, a study called the RAND Health Insurance Experiment randomly assigned thousands of families to different insurance plans, some of which imposed cost-sharing and some of which provided free care. In a bombshell 1981 article in The New England Journal of Medicine , the authors reported that people who received free care used more of it. “Moral hazard” became a credo. (Only in 1986 did the RAND team report that cost-sharing curbed both needed and unneeded care in similar measure.) The consequences were dire. The Heritage Foundation promoted gimmicky “consumer-driven” plans combining sky-high deductibles with tax-advantaged savings accounts that would, they argued, transform patients into prudent consumers. Milton Friedman—the godfather of libertarian economics—pushed the idea to the extreme, recommending that Medicare and Medicaid be abolished and that “every US family unit [be required to] have a major medical insurance policy with a high deductible, say $20,000 a year or 30 percent of the unit’s income.” Most workers in the US once enjoyed first-dollar coverage (no copays or deductibles) for much of their care: in 1982, for instance, only 30 percent of private plans had a deductible for hospital stays. Today 90 percent of private sector workers with job-based individual coverage face a deductible that averages $1,735 a year. Some states have even sought waivers to increase out-of-pocket payments for impoverished Medicaid recipients. In 2015 Indiana, under Governor Mike Pence, announced that such payments could “preserve dignity among members receiving public assistance and provide them with ‘skin in the game.’” Yet reams of evidence confirmed what our patients (and physician colleagues) regard as common sense: copays and deductibles cause people to skip needed care and hence suffer poorer health, and even mortal consequences. Women with breast cancer whose employers shifted them to high-deductible plans wound up delaying diagnostic workups and chemotherapy. Modest prescription copays caused seniors to forgo lifesaving medications. And while copayments and deductibles discouraged care seeking, they didn’t constrain health care spending, which rose from $1,000 per person in 1980—equivalent to spending in other wealthy nations—to $13,493 in 2022, more than double the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. (And notably the life expectancy in the US, which was middle of the pack among high-income nations in 1980, lagged 5.8 years behind the average by 2021.) As “skin in the game” lost its cachet, the big insurers pivoted to other profit-maximizing strategies. For instance, many now focus on privatizing Medicare and Medicaid. Some employ doctors directly and use penalties and bonuses to motivate them to minimize expensive care. Those shifts—along with an ever-growing body of data on medical harms—have perhaps changed the intellectual climate for economists to one more tolerant of jettisoning cost-sharing. Advertisement However, if Einav and Finkelstein (like Baicker, Chandra, and Shepard) have finally gotten some important things right, they continue to miss the mark on others: they embrace a two-tiered medical system and ignore (or, in Baicker and colleagues’ case, advocate policies that would accelerate) the corporate takeover of health care. These are related issues. Treating medical care as a market commodity like microchips or microwaves supports the dual falsehoods that copays benefit society and that market-driven corporatization breeds efficiency and quality. After World War II many nations created national health insurance ( NHI ) or national health service ( NHS ) systems covering their entire populations. The UK’s NHS , for instance, enacted in 1946, provided nearly all care for free. The following year Saskatchewan, under Premier Tommy Douglas (voted the “Greatest Canadian” by CBC viewers in 2004), implemented universal hospital insurance. By 1971 this had been expanded to provide all Canadians with first-dollar coverage for both hospital care and regular doctors’ visits. (Additionally, Canada prohibits private insurers from selling plans that duplicate the public coverage, and doctors and hospitals from accepting most private payments, provisions that keep wealthy and poor Canadians in the same health care boat, bolstering political support for the single-payer system they call Medicare.) 1 It once seemed possible that the US would follow suit. As the UK and some Canadian provinces implemented their systems, the Truman administration proposed an American version of NHI . A campaign led by the American Medical Association—which employed a pioneering public relations firm that painted the NHI bill as a “communist” act—defeated Truman’s push, and employer-paid health insurance filled the void. It had spread during the war—when wage increases but not additional “fringe benefits” were banned—and burgeoned after the war when Congress codified, in 1954, favorable tax treatment of employer-paid benefits. By 1955 private plans covered 65 percent of Americans. Among the millions left out were the unemployed, the elderly, those in agricultural or domestic work, and those working for small employers that didn’t offer health benefits. The civil rights–era enactment of Medicare and Medicaid 2 trimmed the share of Americans without coverage from about 24 percent in 1963 to 11 percent by the late 1970s. But as the power of unions waned under President Reagan, private coverage shrank, and the number of uninsured Americans rose. By 1994 15.8 percent of Americans had no health coverage. The passage in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), which expanded Medicaid and offered new subsidies for private insurance, reversed the trend. Emergency pandemic-era measures—mainly liberalized Medicaid eligibility rules—cut the uninsurance rate to an all-time low of 7.4 percent in 2023. Even so, that meant 25 million Americans remained uninsured, a number that the Congressional Budget Office predicts will grow to 28.2 million next year. These stark figures still understate the precariousness of Americans’ health coverage. Einav and Finkelstein’s research has found that over a two-year period (prepandemic) more than one in five Americans spent at least one month uninsured. The briefest coverage lapses can cause financial ruin and interrupt lifesaving treatment. Under our patchwork public-private system, people lose coverage for many reasons. Some fail to file paperwork required to continue their Medicaid eligibility. Others fall off their parents’ coverage when they turn twenty-six. Or they lose a job or are unable to afford the premiums required by most private plans, including ACA plans. Many immigrants are barred from Medicaid and Medicare. Yet for five decades most US health economists have advised merely caulking the gaps. Obamacare, which was largely designed by MIT ’s Jonathan Gruber, is a prime example. The complex bureaucracy it erected to avoid displacing private insurers added an estimated quarter-trillion dollars between 2014 and 2022 to Americans’ already exorbitant outlays for health insurance administration. Einav and Finkelstein now rightly conclude that more patches won’t work; we have to start from scratch. “Basic coverage,” they write, “must be provided automatically, and financed by the taxpayer.” But their support for tax-funded universal coverage comes with a caveat: to be affordable, the public coverage “should be very basic”—worse than current coverage—with “longer wait times, less patient choice.” It should leave “patients and their physicians not at liberty to get any medical care they both want, as they are currently under Medicare.” But the very concept of “basic coverage” rests on economic and medical fallacies; there is no workable definition of the “basic” or “minimalist” care Einav and Finkelstein propose that would simultaneously slash spending and provide medically adequate care. There is useless care, to be clear, like ineffective drugs or unneeded surgeries. But ineffective treatments (such as the “energy boost” infusions our local urgent care center advertises) shouldn’t be approved by regulators or prescribed by physicians, regardless of costs. Advertisement In the realm of effective care, there is no circumscribable “basic” category that can be safely carved out of coverage. For patients with serious symptoms, long waits to see a specialist are often harmful. For those with uncommon cancers requiring complex surgeries, access to a top-level cancer center where such surgeries are routinely performed can be lifesaving. “Basic coverage” might also exclude expensive treatments deemed cost-ineffective, but many such treatments—like organ transplants or gene therapies for sickle cell disease—are also lifesaving. “Minimalist coverage,” in practice, means greater disability and shorter lives. Recognizing that the affluent wouldn’t abide “basic coverage,” Einav and Finkelstein (like Baicker et al.) would allow “top-up,” or supplemental, coverage in a higher tier. Of course, imposing long lines on working- and middle-class Americans while letting the rich jump the queue isn’t just inequitable; it’s medically hazardous. In the real world of finite health resources—with a limited number of physicians, nurses, PET scanners, and ICU beds—privileging the rich inevitably siphons resources away from everyone else. But a simpler, more efficient, healthier, and fairer alternative has long been available: universal single-tier coverage. Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Bernie Sanders have introduced Medicare for All bills delineating that approach. 3 Critics contend that this would be too expensive, drawing on moral hazard theory and the RAND experiment to argue that eliminating cost barriers would cause patients to overuse their health benefits. Yet the RAND experiment only assessed copayments’ effects on individual patients’ use of care, not society-wide effects, which may differ. In health care, supply often drives (or constrains) a society’s overall use of care. Doctors can fill openings in their schedule by advising more frequent return visits; conversely, they may avoid transferring borderline patients to the ICU when beds are tight. Milton Roemer described this phenomenon with the aphorism “A hospital bed built is a hospital bed filled.” Given limited supplies of doctors and hospital beds, cost-sharing that reduces one group’s use of services would likely increase it for those without cost barriers, redistributing care like toothpaste in a closed tube squeezed on one end. That’s not just a theory. John Wennberg’s pathbreaking analyses of regional variation in care linked the frequency of hospitalizations and operations to the local supply of beds and surgeons. Yet patients’ outcomes in high- and low-use regions were similar, suggesting that some hospitalizations and surgeries were unnecessary. We’ve found that the implementation of both Medicare and Obamacare increased physician visits for the newly covered, but those increases were fully offset by virtually imperceptible decreases for others. A similar phenomenon occurred in other nations when they expanded coverage. For instance, when Quebec implemented its universal health care program in 1970, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine reported that “physician visits per person per year remained constant at about five but were markedly shifted from persons in higher to lower income groups.” The economy of health care is singular. Care is constrained by a finite “supply,” while “demand” for care is unlike demand for most goods; patients want better health, not more colonoscopies or more trips to the operating room. And the types of care that improve health are determined not by consumers’ preferences but by their health needs—that is to say, by discoverable and objective medical facts. Scientific practice and supply planning can more safely and effectively constrain overuse than copays and two-tiered medicine. There is bad behavior, to be sure, but it’s not the behavior of patients with excessive demand; it’s corporate providers that raise costs and subvert care to benefit their bottom lines—a blind spot, as noted, in Einav and Finkelstein’s vision. They address one side of the policy coin—the question of who pays for health care—but neglect the equally important question of who owns it. Any workable prescription for reform must reckon with both. Profit seeking in medicine is not new. Pliny the Elder complained of physicians’ “avarice, their greedy bargains made with those whose fate lies in the balances.” In modern times commercial firms have dominated drug manufacture, and in the early twentieth century small proprietary nursing homes and hospitals were commonplace. But the contemporary takeover of health care provision and financing by mammoth investor-owned firms—what the late Arnold Relman, the New England Journal of Medicine editor-in-chief, described as the “medical-industrial complex” in an influential 1980 editorial 4 —is unprecedented. Beginning in the 1980s investor-owned hospital chains rapidly expanded; between 1980 and 2020 the share of US community hospitals that were for-profit doubled, reaching 24 percent. Meanwhile, among nonprofit hospitals, the advantage conferred by size in negotiating prices with insurers, and hospitals’ increasing reliance on borrowing (which must be paid back from operating profits) to finance construction and other capital needs, prompted both consolidation and the ascendancy of a corporate managerial ethos. The resulting sprawling nonprofit hospital systems that

Advertisement The stock market looks poised for a 7% correction by mid-November, according to technical analyst Mark Newton of Fundstrat. Newton told clients in a note on Thursday that he is expecting the S&P 500 to see weakness heading into November as investor sentiment hits complacent levels just ahead of the general election on November 5. "While intermediate-term bullish these remains very much intact, it's doubtful that US Equities continue to push up into and post-election without any consolidation," Newton said. Newton said the potential correction he expects in the stock market is likely to be a "short-term correction only" and "not the start of a larger decline," playing into Fundstrat's Tom Lee's consistent message that investors should view any decline in the stock market as a "buy the dip" opportunity. Advertisement Newton is monitoring the 5,900 level on the S&P 500 as potential resistance for the index. The S&P 500 traded at around 5,850 on Friday. "The issues with near-term complacency (as judged by low Equity put/call levels), waning breadth, poor seasonal trends and cyclical projections for November as well as SPX's largest sector, Technology, not performing well of late, are all reasons to be alert for possible trend change in the weeks to come," Newton explained. One "key reason" Newton is turning bearish in the short-term is that the current rally in stocks that started in early August is 88 days long, which is exactly how long the April 19 to July 16 rally lasted before a sell-off materialized. From a time perspective, that's "why this rally might 'run out of steam," Newton said. Advertisement Other areas of technical weakness that Newton is monitoring includes negative divergences in momentum as measured by the RSI and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators, a lack of bearish investors as measured by the AAII investor sentiment data, and seasonal cycles that show a peak in the stock market in mid-to-late October followed by a sell-off through November. "This market has seemingly 'dodged a bullet' thus far during one of the historically worst periods during most election years. However, investors should not take this to mean that the coast is clear for an interrupted rally higher all year," Newton said.

Every couple has stated to their spouse at one point, “I do everything!” concerning the division of labor/chores. The top echelon of the Chinese government must feel that way as yet another government agency press conference failed to meet expectations that might have been too high, leaving investors underwhelmed and disappointed. The full notes are below, but the only meaningful data is that 1 million homes will be renovated, loan amounts dedicated to the “white list,” real estate projects deemed too big to fail/too important to fail, will be doubled from the current amount of RMB 2.23 trillion by year-end and specifically mentioned support for housing support for families with two or more children. Also reiterated was the RMB 150B returned to households through the 0.5% mortgage refinancing. The Hang Seng, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were up +2.45%, +1.21%, and +1.59% in morning trading, but fell as it was clear further details on housing support weren’t coming as markets rolled over in afternoon trading to close near intra-day lows. Based on the light volumes, small pullback, and lack of significant selling, markets have realized that implementation details won’t come until the upcoming NPC meeting. Rumors that the NPC will be delayed until after the US election make no sense to me as the domestic economy needs attention, also a delay could be viewed as a sign of weakness. A Mainland media article noted that the market’s recent pullback provides investors with a good entry point, insinuating that more good news is coming based on the “unprecedented” policy coordination amongst government agencies—no real reason to panic, as we just need to be patient. Real estate was the worst-performing sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, as traders took profits though distress developer Suanc fell -27% after issuing 489 million new shares on the stock’s rebound. That is good for bondholders, though not so much for stockholders. Mainland investors bought the Hong Kong dip with a healthy $1.075B of net buying of Hong Kong stocks today with Alibaba, Xiaomi, and Tencent net buys.

In a recent post, he’s shown speaking to a man by the name of Jason who owns a Ferrari SF90 (the owner was ok with being recorded) who wants to trade it in for something else. Why on earth would anyone want to get rid of a 986 horsepower hybrid supercar that’s able to hit 60 mph in less than three seconds and hit a top speed of 211 mph? Because he is totally screwed.

He says that the payments on the SF90 are getting to be a bit much for him and he’s looking to get as close to his loan payoff amount as possible; or even the full pay off amount, which would be nearly impossible. He says he owes “a reasonable” amount on it. The amount is far from reasonable: Jason says he owes a little under $700,000 , specifically $690,000 and some change. The look on Alex’s face says it all before he remarks “oh man.” It’s a massive amount to owe. Advertisement Image : Ferrari Jason says he bought the car in 2021 for $770,000. For him to still owe nearly $700,000 over three years later tells us he probably got a really crappy APR. Alex says he has to be honest with him, that there’s no way he could get close to that amount for the car. He tells Jason the number he’s thinking of starts with a four, which Jason interprets as meaning that he’ll get $400,000 for the SF90. Alex clarifies that he means that he’ll give him over $400,000 for the car, a number Jason still doesn’t like. If you’re paying attention and doing the math, this means Jason has over $200,000 in negative equity on the SF90. He tells Alex that other dealers have been giving him similar numbers. He’s so screwed he says that he had to take out a loan to cover his rent. Advertisement It seems he’s in the situation he’s in because of a job and income change. Jason says back when he purchased the SF90, he was making $30,000-$40,000 a month. Now he says his income is around $10,000 $15,000 a month though he doesn’t exactly say what the change was. He says he put no money down on the SF90 and his payments are $10,000-$11,000 a month. He remarks he should have never bought the car in the first place and he’s right. Even making $40,000 a month, that’s $480,000 annually, meaning the SF90’s purchase price was over 62 percent of his annual income. Alex explains to him the market for the SF90 and gives him examples of others he has seen going for under $500,000 and tells Jason he’s probably not the only person in this situation. Unfortunately there’s nothing that Alex can do to help him out of that $200,000 hole because he can’t roll that much negative equity onto another car like a C8. Alex then asks Jason why the Corvette and Jason’s answer is nearly as wild as this situation: he says he just wants another sports car to drive because he has to “keep a certain kind of image.” Image is the last thing this man should be worrying about. Advertisement Alex says there really isn’t anything he can do to help him and says he’s got to call some friends who are more knowledgeable about situations like this. Before ending the call, Alex says the one thing he can do is a voluntary repossession of the SF90 rather than letting it get repoed, something Jason seems open to doing. Whatever Jason does regarding his SF90, this is a screwed up situation. It also goes to show that even those that you may think are doing better off than you are may be in a life altering, screwed up situation. Show all 131 comments Continue reading

Wealthier Americans driving US economy Skip to content By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com UPDATED: October 18, 2024 at 2:10 p.m. By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s a trend that has surprised many: Why, despite being squeezed by high prices, have Americans kept spending at retail stores and restaurants at a robust pace? One key reason is a relatively simple one: Wealthier consumers, boosted by strong gains in income, home equity and stock market wealth, have increasingly driven the spending. That trend, documented by Federal Reserve research , represents something of a shift from the pre-pandemic period. And it suggests that consumer spending, the primary driver of the U.S. economy, could help sustain healthy growth this year and next. Lower-income consumers, by contrast, have been disproportionately squeezed by higher-priced rent, groceries and other necessities, leaving them less able to spend on discretionary items, like electronics, entertainment and restaurant meals, than they were before the pandemic. Though their spending is starting to rebound as inflation-adjusted incomes rise, it could be years before their finances fully recover. The disparities help explain the gap between gloomy consumer sentiment and widespread evidence of a healthy U.S. economy — a major dynamic in the presidential race that is now in its final weeks. Only a portion of the American population is fueling most of the growth that is evident in government economic data. The trends also help illustrate how the economy has managed to keep expanding at a solid pace even though the Federal Reserve, until last month , kept its key interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Despite the much higher borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards that resulted from the Fed’s rate hikes, inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose 3% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. And it increased at a 2.8% annual rate in the April-June quarter, the government said last month. On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in the United States rose 0.4% from August to September , a solid gain that suggested that shoppers are confident enough in the economy to continue spending freely. Restaurant sales jumped 1%, a particularly encouraging sign because it meant that many people felt they could spend on meals outside the home. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta now estimates that the economy grew at a strong 3.4% in the July-September quarter. Higher-income households have been fortified by huge gains in housing and stock market wealth since the pandemic. Home values have marched steadily up, fueled by high demand and an unusually low supply of houses. And the stock market has been consistently hitting new highs , with the S&P 500 index up a sizzling 22.5% for the year. Roughly 80% of stock market value is owned by the richest 10% of U.S. households. “It speaks to the ongoing strength of those Americans, which is still carrying overall spending,” said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. FILE – Shoppers consider rugs on display in a furniture store June 2, 2024, in Lone Tree, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Housing and stock values have soared in particular for the wealthiest one-tenth of Americans over the past four years. The value of their home equity has leapt 70% from the first quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of this year, according to Fed data — to $17.6 trillion. Their stock and mutual fund wealth has jumped 86%, to just under $37 trillion. Though inflation has eroded some of those gains, they are still quite substantial. Such sharp growth in wealth has reduced the need for affluent Americans to save from their paychecks while still ramping up their spending. A report last week by Fed economists found that before the pandemic, retail spending had been rising for all income groups at roughly the same pace. But about three years ago, the trend shifted: Upper- and middle-income consumers started spending at a much faster pace than lower-earners. By August 2024, inflation-adjusted spending on retail goods was nearly 17% higher than it was in January 2018 for upper-income households, defined as those earning more than $100,000. For middle-income households — earning $60,000 to $100,000 — their spending rose 13.3% during the same period, the Fed study found. And for those earning less than $60,000, spending has risen just 7.9% since 2018. It actually fell from mid-2021 through mid-2023. “Middle- and high-income households have been fueling the strong demand for retail goods,” Fed economist Sinem Hacioglu Hoke and two colleagues wrote. Among those who have felt pressure to spend cautiously is Helaine Rapkin, a 69-year-old teacher who was shopping last week at a Kohl’s in Ramsey, New Jersey, looking for discounts on athletic wear and gifts for her nephew, niece and daughter. Rapkin said she’s wrestling with higher costs on a range of items and isn’t feeling the benefits of a dramatically reduced inflation rate. “I am not feeling good at all,” she said. “I can’t believe how expensive things have gotten…Clothes or food.” Related Articles Business | Olivia Nuzzi, New York magazine part ways Business | GoFundMe bets social media can unlock Gen Z giving.

Start applying now Pearce, in his own research, has found that since the pandemic, lower-income Americans have had to cut their spending on discretionary items. Inflation sharply increased the portion of their income that they had to spend on housing and food, leaving little for other purchases. As a result, for the lowest-income one-fifth of Americans — those earning less than $28,000 — the share of their spending on discretionary items fell 2.5 percentage points by the second quarter of this year compared with 2019. It also declined for the second-lowest one-fifth of households and for the middle fifth. But for the wealthiest one-fifth, the share of their spending on discretionary purchases actually increased. “This has clearly been a very large shock to households, particularly those at the lower end,” Pearce said. “What surprised me is how little has been clawed back.” One sign of the struggles that lower-income consumers have faced is that the proportion of borrowers who are behind on credit cards or auto loans has risen in the past two years to the highest levels in about a decade. Karen Dynan, an economist at Harvard and a nonresident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, suggested, though, that such trends aren’t likely to derail the overall economy. “There are increasing cracks in consumers’ spending,” she said. “But it’s not yet a broader economic story.” Dynan and Pearce say they’re optimistic that consumers overall — including lower-income ones — will keep spending in the coming months as inflation-adjusted incomes keep rising, restoring more of Americans’ purchasing power. “We’re probably past the worst, the most intense pressures on spending from both the inflation shock and from rising interest rates,” Pearce said. “Now, I think the outlook is pretty strong.” AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio contributed to this report from New York.

China Market Update: President Xi, People’s Bank Of China, And China Securities Regulatory Commission Trigger Rally, Week In Review BETA This is a BETA experience. opt-out here Money Investing China Market Update: President Xi, People’s Bank Of China, And China Securities Regulatory Commission Trigger Rally, Week In Review By Brendan Ahern Senior Contributor I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Oct 18, 2024, 10:55am EDT Save Article Comment CLN KraneShares Week in Review Asian equities were mixed but mostly higher this week as Mainland China, especially the technology-focused STAR Board, outperformed, and Hong Kong underperformed. Hong Kong's downdraft this week exposed the fragility of China's recent bull market, as investors await more stimulus and consumer support confirmations from the National People's Congress (NPC), which is expected to convene in the coming weeks. China reported trade and inflation data for September this week, indicating that inflation was light but not negative, while import and export growth fell short of expectations. Semiconductor names across Asia received a boost from Taiwan Semiconductor's strong earnings beat on Thursday. Key News Asian equities were higher overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China outperformed while South Korea underperformed. The mid-morning September Chinese economic data release was a factor as GDP, retail sales, and industrial production beat expectations. However, the real catalysts for today’s rally were comments from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and especially President Xi. Technology was the best sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, closing higher by +6.48% and +7.96%, due to President Xi’s comments while visiting Anhui province. He stated, “…science and technology must take the lead, with technological innovation being the necessary path to follow…” and “High-tech development cannot be begged for; we must accelerate the realization of high-level technological self-reliance and self-improvement,” according to the South China Morning Post. Mainland media noted his comments “that it is necessary to accelerate technological innovation and industrial transformation and upgrading.” Yesterday’s note mentioned President Xi must be frustrated that recent agency press conferences have caused markets to fall after there is a clear effort to get the stock market higher. Also fueling the rally was PBOC President Pan’s speech at the 2024 Financial Street Forum Annual Meeting. While acknowledging the challenges facing the economy, including real estate, he outlined a clear path of policy changes that have occurred and will occur, including mentioning banks' deposit reserve ratio, which is the amount of deposits that need to be held. The lower the deposit reserve ratio, the more banks will be able to lend, which will likely be lowered again soon with the government’s focus on the economy. Pan reviewed the monetary policy bazooka unleashed while mentioning that “the deposit reserve ratio will be further reduced by 0.25 - 0.5 percentage points at an appropriate time” following the September 27th reduction by 0.5%. In addition, the 7-day reverse repo rate was lowered by 0.2%, the medium-term lending facility was lowered by 0.3% to 2%, and the 1—and 5-year loan prime rates were lowered by 0.2% and 0.25%, respectively. Read More: China Market Update: Mainland Investors Cheer Loan Prime Rate Cu He also reiterated that the mortgage refinancing, swap line for buying stocks from mutual funds, insurance and brokerage houses, and the loans available for companies to buy back stock. He acknowledged the challenges, especially domestic consumption, stating, “The current economic operation needs to implement strong macro-total support policies…. insufficient effective demand, weak social expectations, low-priced operations, etc., and the market generally believes that it is necessary to launch a large-scale macro policy.” Due to the challenges, “The central government's decisive decision to launch a package of incremental policies reflects the firm determination to stabilize the economy, expectations, promote consumption, and benefit people's livelihoods. “ A fascinating line here: “The role of consumption continues to increase, and the proportion of consumption, investment, and net exports to GDP has been adjusted from 49%, 47%, and 4% in 2010 to 56%, 42%, and 2% in 2023.” CSRC Chairman Wu Qing’s speech at the Financial Street Forum acknowledged the economic challenges though recent policies should be effective, stating, “We believe that with the accelerated implementation of key reform tasks and the successive launch of a package of incremental policies, stock policies continue to exert force, and the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery will be more stable and stable.” His speech focused on capital market reforms but did mention “we need to accelerate the implementation of guidance on long-term capital entering the market” while referencing the swap and buyback programs. Yes, there was the economic data release! Q3 GDP was 4.6% versus expectations of 4.5%, and Q2’s 4.7% September Industrial Production was 5.4% versus expectations of 4.6%, and August’s 4.5% September retail sales were 3.2% versus expectations of 2.5%, and August’s 2.1% Online retail sales increased by +8.6% year to date versus the same time period last year. September fixed asset investment was 3.4% versus expectations of 3.3%, and August’s 3.4% September real estate data was unsurprisingly weak, with new home prices down -0.71% month over month, used home prices down -0.93% month over month, and property investment down -10.1% year over year Growth stocks/sectors led the way in both the Hong Kong and Chinese markets, which exhibited very strong breadth and volumes, as recent profit takers might be kicking themselves today. Mainland investors took profits via Southbound Stock Connect in a rare net sell day—$399 million, with the Hong Kong Tracker ETF a large net sell, though Alibaba and Tencent were net buys. Worth noting that Alibaba filed that they bought their ADR yesterday on weakness. Smart! The WSJ’s Gregory Ip wrote a great article on Trump’s tariff policies and potential consequences. Funny, the number of references to the 1930s! Was that a good economic time period? The excerpt below is from the 2020 NY Fed blog post-Liberty Street Economics. What if there is no trade deficit? Discussions of the trade war often focus only on U.S. exports to and imports from China, missing the much larger exposure of U.S. firms emanating from their subsidiaries in China. For example, while the United States only exported $130 billion of goods to China in 2017, sales by U.S. multinationals in China amounted to $376 billion that year. Although the large bilateral deficit in 2017 was driven by the fact that U.S. exports to China were only a quarter as large as Chinese exports to the United States, total sales (exports plus multinational sales) by U.S. firms in China were $505 billion—only 11 percent lower than total sales by Chinese firms in the U.S. market ($570 billion).

Is China Facing a Deflationary Trap? by Patrick Bolton & Haizhou Huang - Project Syndicate Skip to main content Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images en English zh Chinese pt Portuguese es Spanish Economics 0 Is China Facing a Deflationary Trap? Oct 18, 2024 Patrick Bolton and Haizhou Huang With China teetering on the edge of a deflationary trap, the question of how to avoid a Japanese-style "lost three decades" has become urgent. While China’s government is on the right track with its recently announced stimulus package, more is needed to break the cycle of declining spending and falling prices. BEIJING/LONDON – About two years ago, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s economy hit a roadblock. As all sectors underwent deleveraging, economic growth slowed, household savings rates increased, and businesses scaled back their investments and accumulated savings. Many now wonder whether consumers and companies are stuck in a self-reinforcing cycle of declining spending and falling prices, which would have the pernicious effect of increasing the real value of debt. https://prosyn.org/NdqlEEq To continue reading, register now.

A Look At The Fair Value Of Bonia Corporation Berhad (KLSE:BONIA) Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 11:46 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 Key Insights The projected fair value for Bonia Corporation Berhad is RM1.86 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Bonia Corporation Berhad's RM1.55 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Bonia Corporation Berhad's peers are currently trading at a premium of 35% on average Does the October share price for Bonia Corporation Berhad ( KLSE:BONIA ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Bonia Corporation Berhad The Calculation We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (MYR, Millions) RM40.6m RM35.9m RM33.4m RM32.2m RM31.7m RM31.7m RM32.0m RM32.6m RM33.3m RM34.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Est @ -17.81% Est @ -11.40% Est @ -6.92% Est @ -3.78% Est @ -1.58% Est @ -0.04% Est @ 1.04% Est @ 1.79% Est @ 2.32% Est @ 2.69% Present Value (MYR, Millions) Discounted @ 11% RM36.6 RM29.2 RM24.5 RM21.3 RM18.9 RM17.0 RM15.5 RM14.2 RM13.1 RM12.2 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St) Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM203m After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%. Terminal Value (TV) = FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = RM34m× (1 + 3.6%) ÷ (11%– 3.6%) = RM483m Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = RM483m÷ ( 1 + 11%) 10 = RM172m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM374m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of RM1.6, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf Important Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Bonia Corporation Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.315. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. SWOT Analysis for Bonia Corporation Berhad Strength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Malaysian market. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat No apparent threats visible for BONIA. Moving On: Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Bonia Corporation Berhad, we've compiled three further elements you should further research: Risks : Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Arm Holdings plc (ARM) Teams Up with Industry Leaders to Launch Advanced AI CPU Chiplet Platform for Cloud and HPC Applications Read full article Ghazal Ahmed Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 4:39 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. S&P 500 to Reach 6,000 by Year-End Amid AI Boom and Earnings Growth Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs . Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Overall ARM ranks 18th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Flexjet sells partial ownership of private planes for a set number of flying hours.

But there's another way to fly private that can be much more accessible: fractional ownership . This model allows companies or individuals to split "ownership" of a private plane by buying into a set amount of yearly hours and then paying the hourly rate when they fly. The operator covers ongoing costs like staffing and maintenance. This is the core business model of Flexjet, a US-based private aircraft operator with a fleet of more than 270 planes. It offers a range of options, including Embraer light jets, Sikorsky helicopters, Bombardier Challengers, and the ultra-long-range Gulfstream G650 . Among Flexjet's most recent additions to its US portfolio is the $23 million Embraer Praetor 600 . It's an improved variant of Embraer's Legacy fleet and builds on its Praetor 500 sister jet with ultramodern avionics, a larger cabin, and a longer range. Advertisement Business Insider toured a Flexjet Praetor 600 at Westchester County Airport in New York on Wednesday to see what it offers customers. Advertisement The Praetor 600 is part of Flexjet's "fractional jet ownership" program. The Praetor 600 is just one of hundreds of Flexjet's fractional owner planes. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Flexjet is the second-largest fractional ownership operator behind NetJets by share of flight hours. "It's like a country club; there's an initial buy-in to join, then there's a monthly due to cover the fixed cost of ownership, then there's the direct hourly operating cost when you go out to fly your hours," Anthony Sibilla, sales VP for Flexjet, told Business Insider during the tour. Flexjet's fractional ownership starts at 1/16, or 50 hours a year, and goes up to a half share, or 400 hours. So, instead of paying $23 million for the Praetor 600 plus all of the upkeep and operating expenses, buyers are paying a much smaller amount with up to 15 other customers. Advertisement Flexjet's fractional owners are 80% Fortune 500 companies and 20% high-net-worth people, Sibilla said. First launched in June 2019, the dual-engine Praetor lists for about $23 million. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Sibilla said the customers are very territory-specific. "The New York City area is a lot of private equity, real estate, and finance" companies, he said. "Houston is oil and gas; in the Bay Area, it's a lot of tech companies." South Florida's fractional jet ownership market historically included many New Yorkers who retired or had a second home in the state. More recently, customers have included companies like Citadel and Goldman Sachs that relocated to the Sunshine State during the pandemic, Sibilla said. Advertisement Buyers pay around $10,000 an hour to fly on the Praetor 600. Inside the Praetor 600. Taylor Rains/Business Insider $10,000 is expensive — it's more than three times the median mortgage payment in the US. But for wealthy fliers, it can cut some of the time, hassle, and inflexibility associated with commercial flying. Sibilla said the Flexjet's hourly rate, which he emphasized was a rough average, is the "all-in operating cost." This covers extras like fuel and the pro-rated monthly management fee , which includes costs such as maintenance and insurance. He said the company can guarantee the aircraft's availability within 10 hours. It also has another perk: fractional owners can be hard to track. Elon Musk, for example, has been vocal about jet trackers following his whereabouts . Apple CEO Tim Cook and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault only rent private planes due to security and privacy concerns. Advertisement Flexjet's Praetor 600 can fly up to about 4,600 miles, or nearly eight hours nonstop. Sibilla said customers use fractional ownership for both business and pleasure. Taylor Rains/Business Insider The super-midsized category jet is bigger and longer-ranged than the midsize Praetor 500 and is better suited for longer trips. It can connect cities like London and New York or São Paulo and Miami, flying about 700 miles further than its sister jet. In the US, Sibilla said Flexjet's Praetor 600 is frequently used between New York and Palm Beach in Florida, but leisure travelers also commonly fly it to ski destinations like Bozeman, Montana, and Aspen, Colorado. He said the Praetor 600's 150 cubic feet of storage can accommodate the snowboard and ski gear needed for these high-dollar vacations. Advertisement The plane can carry two pilots and up to nine passengers. Flexjet has an interior design center in Ohio. Taylor Rains/Business Insider There are six loungers and a three-person divan available on board, with two pilots in the cockpit. Sibilla said Flexjet has customized the interiors of its aircraft with different color schemes and designs to give its customers a homey environment and bridge the gap between fractional ownership and wholly owning the jet. Flexjet pilots are specific to the plane's tail number to further personalize the fractional experience, as well, he said. Advertisement The divan can be converted into a bed. Flyers have a lie-flat bed option on the Praetor 600. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Having a bed onboard can greatly increase the value of a larger plane like the Praetor 600, especially on transatlantic or cross-country routes. The individual lounges can also be adjusted into twin beds, but Sibilla said the seat's legrest and deep recline are often comfortable enough for flyers. Advertisement Customers can cater almost any food. Catering was set up to demonstrate part of a cabin server's job, though servers are not staffed on the Praetor 600. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Flexjet has a standardized menu but the company said it can accommodate customer requests — meaning anything from five-star luxury restaurants to McDonald's french fries. Customers can eat at the pull-out tables between each set of forward and aft loungers. Sibilla said some of its private planes, like the Gulfstream G450, automatically staff a "cabin server," which is Flexjet's term for a flight attendant. The Praetor 600 doesn't offer servers. Its galley has a convection oven and other equipment to prepare meals. Advertisement There is a lavatory and storage room in the back of the jet. The sink and mirror are opposite the toilet. Taylor Rains/Business Insider The bathroom was surprisingly chic, with woodlike finishes, a sink, a mirror, and even a window. The toilet's thick cushion cover is distinctive from commercial plane bathrooms. The storage room, accessible from the bathroom, can hold snacks, toiletries, and other items. Advertisement The cockpit has advanced avionics for safety and efficiency. The cockpit does not have a yoke. Taylor Rains/Business Insider The Praetor 600 has an advanced fly-by-wire system (meaning the pilot doesn't have a yoke) that is designed to make flying easier and less busy. The large cockpit screens aim to help with workflow and situational awareness. The Praetor 600 and its Praetor 500 sister jet have one of the world's best safety records, according to an analysis of safety records by charter broker Stratos Jet Charters. The plan also offers inflight WiFi, a DVD player, a sound system, and cabin controls for temperature and lighting. Advertisement Flyers can use a private terminal in some cities. Flexjet has private terminals at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, Dallas Love Field, and Van Nuys Airport near Los Angeles, and it plans to add more in Florida, Montana, and Arizona. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Private jet passengers can often avoid the hassle of airport security and instead fly out of private terminals. Flexjet has a handful of dedicated terminals, meaning in some cities, it doesn't share a space with competitor charter companies , flight schools, or other general aviation flights. This includes Westchester, where customers can have private meetings or enjoy a drink or sandwich in the lobby before a flight, or they can simply drive straight up to their plane on the tarmac. Flexjet also operates its own maintenance hangar at the airport. Advertisement It's easy to see the benefits of fractional ownership. The galley had plenty of storage and meal prep equipment. Taylor Rains/Business Insider It's hard not to see the appeal of fractional ownership. It offers privacy and convenience while avoiding all the leg work of fully owning a personal or corporate jet. And the hourly rate might make sense for corporate travel. A company flying nine people from New York to Florida might spend roughly $30,000 on the three-hour one-way flight, which is about $3,300 per person. A Delta Air Lines domestic first-class ticket on the same route in December ranges from $500 to $1,500 per seat. The Delta flight is still half the price or less overall, but wealthy fractional buyers may be willing to pay extra for the time savings, comfort, and peace of mind of a private plane — not to mention the potential tax benefits for business travel .

Advertisement In the valley below the Teton mountain range, some of the wealthiest people in America kick back on their terraces and look out at a vast mountain landscape where mansions are hidden in the towering evergreen trees. They have saunas in their houses and spend thousands on custom-made cowboy hats with diamond bands. I'm talking about the wealthy enclave of Jackson Hole in Teton County, Wyoming — one of the richest counties in the US. Jackson Hole has long been a billionaire hideout and the city with the most unequal income in the US . According to the Economic Policy Institute , the top 1% of residents in the metro area earn 132 times the income of the bottom 99% of residents. The average income of the top 1% sits above a cool $16 million. Advertisement A-listers from Kanye West and the Kardashians to Sandra Bullock and Harrison Ford have bought property in Jackson Hole. Still, I recently visited the city for the first time to see what makes this place so coveted for high earners. Advertisement Lower taxes and mountain views draw wealthy DINKs and boomers to Jackson Hole. Pedestrians stroll through Downtown Jackson. Joey Hadden/Business Insider From Texas to California, affluent Americans are buying up property in Jackson Hole, a luxurious Wyoming escape. The city has fewer than 11,000 residents where mansions dot mountain ranges, and a stroll downtown feels like the Wild West — if you ignore the hoodies, baseball caps, and automobiles. Jackson Hole real-estate agent Sam Haack told Business Insider that his clients are usually boomers or DINKs (dual-income, no kids). "The baby boomers have largely gained their wealth through their appreciation of assets over the years like their equity portfolios, other homes, and businesses," he said. "Some of these clients may still work W2 jobs in finance, consulting, or real estate but are usually business owners and entrepreneurs." Haack added that about 40% of his sales are for full-time residents, and the other 60% are second homes and investment properties. Sotheby's Jackson Hole-based real-estate agent Laurie Huff told BI that her clientele is similar. "Our clients in the past few years have ranged in age from 30 to 60 years and come from high-net-worth backgrounds," she said in a statement. "A finance/business background seems to account for a large percentage." She added that about half of her clients move in full-time. "Others stay for six-plus months and then spend part of the year in a warmer climate," she wrote. Advertisement Jackson Hole is located in Teton County, Wyoming. Jackson Hole is on the western edge of Wyoming. Google Maps Jackson Hole is a 60-mile-long valley in Teton County, Wyoming, that includes the towns of Jackson, Moose, Teton Village, and Wilson. Kelly is a small, census-designated place in the greater Jackson Hole area that's worth mentioning because it's home to the most expensive listing in Wyoming right now, a $65,000,000 luxury ranch. Advertisement Only 3% of the entire county can be built on — making the real estate inherently a buyer's market. A wealthy neighborhood in Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider According to Viehman Group's 2024 third-quarter Jackson Hole Real Estate report, the average price of a listing in the city over the last three months was $6.42 million. Today, the most expensive house on the market is a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home on more than 9,100 square feet that is listed at $40 million . "As a buyer, it is so competitive because of simple supply and demand," Haack told BI. "We have always had much more demand than supply because, well, it's one of the most beautiful places in the US, and the lifestyle is unmatched." The supply is very limited — only 3% of the county is private land that can be built on. "The rest is public land owned by the federal, state, or local governments," he added. Because of the scarcity of available land, Haack said buyers "tend to hang onto these properties for the appreciation and tax advantages, leading to even less inventory and supply."

Joey Hadden/Business Insider As we put our seats in the upright position to prepare for landing on my flight to Jackson Hole, I looked out the window to see Grand Teton National Park from above. Mountain ranges went on for miles between valleys and bodies of water. It was one of the most epic views I've seen from a plane. People who live here get this view on every flight home into Jackson Hole Airport , one of the smallest and most luxurious in the country, located inside Teton National Park. It's so small that passengers enter and exit the plane from outside. When I stepped onto the tarmac, I was immediately taken by the freshness of the air. I smelled hints of pine trees as the wind blew through my hair. Before heading into the airport to exit, I spun around for a 360-degree view of the mountains. Advertisement The most developed part of the valley is the town of Jackson. Million Dollar Cowboy Bar is in Downtown Jackson. Joey Hadden/Business Insider Home to the famous Million Dollar Cowboy Bar , Jackson is a small town with shops, restaurants, and architecture reminiscent of the American West. When I visited, the downtown area was full of tourists, but retail seemed to cater to locals, too. There were home furniture and decor stores on every block. And I think tourists shouldn't miss the celebrity-loved, luxury cowboy hat store, Kemo Sabe. Staff members mold the hats and customize them with bands, features, and branding right in the store. Haack told BI that families tend to move to East Jackson, which is conveniently located near the town square. According to Sotheby's International Realty , the area has a mix of condos, townhouses, and single-family homes costing as much as $8.7 million. "You'll find young families that ride their e-bikes to work and to get ice cream in the summer," he said of the area. Advertisement From Wilson to Teton Village, the other parts of Jackson Hole are more remote — and expensive. A mansion sits on a hill in Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider The richest residents in Jackson Hole tend to live in the more remote areas around Jackson in the greater Jackson Hole region: Kelly, Moose, Teton Village, and Wilson. Haack told BI that Teton Village and Wilson typically have the largest and most expensive homes in Jackson Hole. "These two areas are popular due to their more quiet nature as well as being outside of the now traffic-filled town of Jackson," he added. Advertisement These homes can be up to three stories high and have stunning architecture, water features, and, of course, views. A mega mansion in Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider During my trip, I saw a mix of luxury cabins and modern mansions in these neighborhoods. "The two main categories of architecture we see in Jackson Hole are log cabin (old Jackson style) and Mountain Modern (new Jackson style)," Haack told BI. "Log cabins never go out of style but do require a lot more maintenance." I saw modern homes with mixed materials, sleek exteriors, flat roofs, and patios with water features like fountains and mini falls. I even went inside a mansion and found unique features — from an indoor sauna to a double-sided fireplace. Due to zoning constrictions, Jackson Hole's mega mansions can only be up to three stories tall, so many are sprawled out like ranches on vast properties. Advertisement It seems like no matter where the rich choose to live in Jackson, they have incredible views. Mountains are visible behind a street in Jackson. Joey Hadden/Business Insider After seeing Jackson Hole for myself, I can see why people want to move and vacation there. The ultra-luxury vibe with Western flair seems like an ideal place to escape.

Advertisement The stock market looks poised for a 7% correction by mid-November, according to technical analyst Mark Newton of Fundstrat. Newton told clients in a note on Thursday that he is expecting the S&P 500 to see weakness heading into November as investor sentiment hits complacent levels just ahead of the general election on November 5. "While intermediate-term bullish these remains very much intact, it's doubtful that US Equities continue to push up into and post-election without any consolidation," Newton said. Newton said the potential correction he expects in the stock market is likely to be a "short-term correction only" and "not the start of a larger decline," playing into Fundstrat's Tom Lee's consistent message that investors should view any decline in the stock market as a "buy the dip" opportunity. Advertisement Newton is monitoring the 5,900 level on the S&P 500 as potential resistance for the index. The S&P 500 traded at around 5,850 on Friday. "The issues with near-term complacency (as judged by low Equity put/call levels), waning breadth, poor seasonal trends and cyclical projections for November as well as SPX's largest sector, Technology, not performing well of late, are all reasons to be alert for possible trend change in the weeks to come," Newton explained. One "key reason" Newton is turning bearish in the short-term is that the current rally in stocks that started in early August is 88 days long, which is exactly how long the April 19 to July 16 rally lasted before a sell-off materialized. From a time perspective, that's "why this rally might 'run out of steam," Newton said. Advertisement Other areas of technical weakness that Newton is monitoring includes negative divergences in momentum as measured by the RSI and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators, a lack of bearish investors as measured by the AAII investor sentiment data, and seasonal cycles that show a peak in the stock market in mid-to-late October followed by a sell-off through November. "This market has seemingly 'dodged a bullet' thus far during one of the historically worst periods during most election years. However, investors should not take this to mean that the coast is clear for an interrupted rally higher all year," Newton said.

Wealthier Americans driving US economy Skip to content By Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com UPDATED: October 18, 2024 at 2:10 p.m. By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s a trend that has surprised many: Why, despite being squeezed by high prices, have Americans kept spending at retail stores and restaurants at a robust pace? One key reason is a relatively simple one: Wealthier consumers, boosted by strong gains in income, home equity and stock market wealth, have increasingly driven the spending. That trend, documented by Federal Reserve research , represents something of a shift from the pre-pandemic period. And it suggests that consumer spending, the primary driver of the U.S. economy, could help sustain healthy growth this year and next. Lower-income consumers, by contrast, have been disproportionately squeezed by higher-priced rent, groceries and other necessities, leaving them less able to spend on discretionary items, like electronics, entertainment and restaurant meals, than they were before the pandemic. Though their spending is starting to rebound as inflation-adjusted incomes rise, it could be years before their finances fully recover. The disparities help explain the gap between gloomy consumer sentiment and widespread evidence of a healthy U.S. economy — a major dynamic in the presidential race that is now in its final weeks. Only a portion of the American population is fueling most of the growth that is evident in government economic data. The trends also help illustrate how the economy has managed to keep expanding at a solid pace even though the Federal Reserve, until last month , kept its key interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Despite the much higher borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards that resulted from the Fed’s rate hikes, inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose 3% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. And it increased at a 2.8% annual rate in the April-June quarter, the government said last month. On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales in the United States rose 0.4% from August to September , a solid gain that suggested that shoppers are confident enough in the economy to continue spending freely. Restaurant sales jumped 1%, a particularly encouraging sign because it meant that many people felt they could spend on meals outside the home. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta now estimates that the economy grew at a strong 3.4% in the July-September quarter. Higher-income households have been fortified by huge gains in housing and stock market wealth since the pandemic. Home values have marched steadily up, fueled by high demand and an unusually low supply of houses. And the stock market has been consistently hitting new highs , with the S&P 500 index up a sizzling 22.5% for the year. Roughly 80% of stock market value is owned by the richest 10% of U.S. households. “It speaks to the ongoing strength of those Americans, which is still carrying overall spending,” said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. FILE – Shoppers consider rugs on display in a furniture store June 2, 2024, in Lone Tree, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Housing and stock values have soared in particular for the wealthiest one-tenth of Americans over the past four years. The value of their home equity has leapt 70% from the first quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of this year, according to Fed data — to $17.6 trillion. Their stock and mutual fund wealth has jumped 86%, to just under $37 trillion. Though inflation has eroded some of those gains, they are still quite substantial. Such sharp growth in wealth has reduced the need for affluent Americans to save from their paychecks while still ramping up their spending. A report last week by Fed economists found that before the pandemic, retail spending had been rising for all income groups at roughly the same pace. But about three years ago, the trend shifted: Upper- and middle-income consumers started spending at a much faster pace than lower-earners. By August 2024, inflation-adjusted spending on retail goods was nearly 17% higher than it was in January 2018 for upper-income households, defined as those earning more than $100,000. For middle-income households — earning $60,000 to $100,000 — their spending rose 13.3% during the same period, the Fed study found. And for those earning less than $60,000, spending has risen just 7.9% since 2018. It actually fell from mid-2021 through mid-2023. “Middle- and high-income households have been fueling the strong demand for retail goods,” Fed economist Sinem Hacioglu Hoke and two colleagues wrote. Among those who have felt pressure to spend cautiously is Helaine Rapkin, a 69-year-old teacher who was shopping last week at a Kohl’s in Ramsey, New Jersey, looking for discounts on athletic wear and gifts for her nephew, niece and daughter. Rapkin said she’s wrestling with higher costs on a range of items and isn’t feeling the benefits of a dramatically reduced inflation rate. “I am not feeling good at all,” she said. “I can’t believe how expensive things have gotten…Clothes or food.” Related Articles Business | Olivia Nuzzi, New York magazine part ways Business | GoFundMe bets social media can unlock Gen Z giving.

Start applying now Pearce, in his own research, has found that since the pandemic, lower-income Americans have had to cut their spending on discretionary items. Inflation sharply increased the portion of their income that they had to spend on housing and food, leaving little for other purchases. As a result, for the lowest-income one-fifth of Americans — those earning less than $28,000 — the share of their spending on discretionary items fell 2.5 percentage points by the second quarter of this year compared with 2019. It also declined for the second-lowest one-fifth of households and for the middle fifth. But for the wealthiest one-fifth, the share of their spending on discretionary purchases actually increased. “This has clearly been a very large shock to households, particularly those at the lower end,” Pearce said. “What surprised me is how little has been clawed back.” One sign of the struggles that lower-income consumers have faced is that the proportion of borrowers who are behind on credit cards or auto loans has risen in the past two years to the highest levels in about a decade. Karen Dynan, an economist at Harvard and a nonresident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, suggested, though, that such trends aren’t likely to derail the overall economy. “There are increasing cracks in consumers’ spending,” she said. “But it’s not yet a broader economic story.” Dynan and Pearce say they’re optimistic that consumers overall — including lower-income ones — will keep spending in the coming months as inflation-adjusted incomes keep rising, restoring more of Americans’ purchasing power. “We’re probably past the worst, the most intense pressures on spending from both the inflation shock and from rising interest rates,” Pearce said. “Now, I think the outlook is pretty strong.” AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio contributed to this report from New York.

Following Oct 18, 2024, 10:55am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Week in Review Asian equities were mixed but mostly higher this week as Mainland China, especially the technology-focused STAR Board, outperformed, and Hong Kong underperformed. Hong Kong's downdraft this week exposed the fragility of China's recent bull market, as investors await more stimulus and consumer support confirmations from the National People's Congress (NPC), which is expected to convene in the coming weeks. China reported trade and inflation data for September this week, indicating that inflation was light but not negative, while import and export growth fell short of expectations. Semiconductor names across Asia received a boost from Taiwan Semiconductor's strong earnings beat on Thursday. Key News Asian equities were higher overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China outperformed while South Korea underperformed. The mid-morning September Chinese economic data release was a factor as GDP, retail sales, and industrial production beat expectations. However, the real catalysts for today’s rally were comments from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and especially President Xi. Technology was the best sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, closing higher by +6.48% and +7.96%, due to President Xi’s comments while visiting Anhui province. He stated, “…science and technology must take the lead, with technological innovation being the necessary path to follow…” and “High-tech development cannot be begged for; we must accelerate the realization of high-level technological self-reliance and self-improvement,” according to the South China Morning Post. Mainland media noted his comments “that it is necessary to accelerate technological innovation and industrial transformation and upgrading.” Yesterday’s note mentioned President Xi must be frustrated that recent agency press conferences have caused markets to fall after there is a clear effort to get the stock market higher. Also fueling the rally was PBOC President Pan’s speech at the 2024 Financial Street Forum Annual Meeting. While acknowledging the challenges facing the economy, including real estate, he outlined a clear path of policy changes that have occurred and will occur, including mentioning banks' deposit reserve ratio, which is the amount of deposits that need to be held. The lower the deposit reserve ratio, the more banks will be able to lend, which will likely be lowered again soon with the government’s focus on the economy. Pan reviewed the monetary policy bazooka unleashed while mentioning that “the deposit reserve ratio will be further reduced by 0.25 - 0.5 percentage points at an appropriate time” following the September 27th reduction by 0.5%. In addition, the 7-day reverse repo rate was lowered by 0.2%, the medium-term lending facility was lowered by 0.3% to 2%, and the 1—and 5-year loan prime rates were lowered by 0.2% and 0.25%, respectively.

He acknowledged the challenges, especially domestic consumption, stating, “The current economic operation needs to implement strong macro-total support policies…. insufficient effective demand, weak social expectations, low-priced operations, etc., and the market generally believes that it is necessary to launch a large-scale macro policy.” Due to the challenges, “The central government's decisive decision to launch a package of incremental policies reflects the firm determination to stabilize the economy, expectations, promote consumption, and benefit people's livelihoods. “ A fascinating line here: “The role of consumption continues to increase, and the proportion of consumption, investment, and net exports to GDP has been adjusted from 49%, 47%, and 4% in 2010 to 56%, 42%, and 2% in 2023.” CSRC Chairman Wu Qing’s speech at the Financial Street Forum acknowledged the economic challenges though recent policies should be effective, stating, “We believe that with the accelerated implementation of key reform tasks and the successive launch of a package of incremental policies, stock policies continue to exert force, and the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery will be more stable and stable.” His speech focused on capital market reforms but did mention “we need to accelerate the implementation of guidance on long-term capital entering the market” while referencing the swap and buyback programs. Yes, there was the economic data release! Q3 GDP was 4.6% versus expectations of 4.5%, and Q2’s 4.7% September Industrial Production was 5.4% versus expectations of 4.6%, and August’s 4.5% September retail sales were 3.2% versus expectations of 2.5%, and August’s 2.1% Online retail sales increased by +8.6% year to date versus the same time period last year. September fixed asset investment was 3.4% versus expectations of 3.3%, and August’s 3.4% September real estate data was unsurprisingly weak, with new home prices down -0.71% month over month, used home prices down -0.93% month over month, and property investment down -10.1% year over year Growth stocks/sectors led the way in both the Hong Kong and Chinese markets, which exhibited very strong breadth and volumes, as recent profit takers might be kicking themselves today. Mainland investors took profits via Southbound Stock Connect in a rare net sell day—$399 million, with the Hong Kong Tracker ETF a large net sell, though Alibaba and Tencent were net buys. Worth noting that Alibaba filed that they bought their ADR yesterday on weakness. Smart! The WSJ’s Gregory Ip wrote a great article on Trump’s tariff policies and potential consequences. Funny, the number of references to the 1930s! Was that a good economic time period? The excerpt below is from the 2020 NY Fed blog post-Liberty Street Economics. What if there is no trade deficit? Discussions of the trade war often focus only on U.S. exports to and imports from China, missing the much larger exposure of U.S. firms emanating from their subsidiaries in China. For example, while the United States only exported $130 billion of goods to China in 2017, sales by U.S. multinationals in China amounted to $376 billion that year. Although the large bilateral deficit in 2017 was driven by the fact that U.S. exports to China were only a quarter as large as Chinese exports to the United States, total sales (exports plus multinational sales) by U.S. firms in China were $505 billion—only 11 percent lower than total sales by Chinese firms in the U.S. market ($570 billion).

Is China Facing a Deflationary Trap? by Patrick Bolton & Haizhou Huang - Project Syndicate Skip to main content Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images en English zh Chinese pt Portuguese es Spanish Economics 0 Is China Facing a Deflationary Trap? Oct 18, 2024 Patrick Bolton and Haizhou Huang With China teetering on the edge of a deflationary trap, the question of how to avoid a Japanese-style "lost three decades" has become urgent. While China’s government is on the right track with its recently announced stimulus package, more is needed to break the cycle of declining spending and falling prices. BEIJING/LONDON – About two years ago, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s economy hit a roadblock. As all sectors underwent deleveraging, economic growth slowed, household savings rates increased, and businesses scaled back their investments and accumulated savings. Many now wonder whether consumers and companies are stuck in a self-reinforcing cycle of declining spending and falling prices, which would have the pernicious effect of increasing the real value of debt. https://prosyn.org/NdqlEEq To continue reading, register now.

Strategist Who Called China Rally Sees More Room for Gains Read full article 1 / 2 Strategist Who Called China Rally Sees More Room for Gains Charlotte Yang and Ye Xie Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 6:33 AM 3 min read Link Copied 3 (Bloomberg) -- A Bank of America Corp. options strategist who correctly anticipated gains in the past is now saying the rally that’s made Chinese equities some of the world’s best this year may have more room to go. And many are positioning for it. Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Inside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Demand for bullish bets has increased since the nation announced a slew of initiatives to revive its economy, according to Lars Naeckter, the bank’s head of Asia Pacific equity derivatives research. The cost of call options versus puts is near its highest level since at least 2008 for Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong as well as for a US exchange-traded fund tracking the shares. While the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has given up almost half of its recent gains, Naeckter says the market could still rally further given the nation’s policy pivot and investors’ appetite to re-enter the trade. In early September, as the equity gauge traded near a low, he recommended a bullish options structure that returned more than 360%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose as much as 2.9% on Friday. “The opportunities are still there,” Naeckter said in an interview in Hong Kong this week. “There’s significant upside potential for this market from here, as we balance the uncertainty with the ongoing stimulus measures in terms of scope and timing.” Like Bank of America, other firms are seeing more gains ahead. Over at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the trading desk recommended last week Hang Seng Enterprises call spreads and collars — buying puts while selling calls — to take advantage of the elevated implied volatility. Bank of America advised earlier this month to roll the September Hang Seng Enterprises trade into November/December calendar call spread collars that will also cover the upcoming US presidential election — the firm expects volatility to remain elevated until the vote and fall after. Additionally, Naeckter’s team suggested bullish options strategies on the US-listed iShares China Large-Cap ETF. “There is going to be continued noise between the US and China and the ongoing uncertainty around that,” Naeckter said in the interview on Monday. “However, for market participants, the bigger elephant in the room is Chinese policy and the meetings that are coming up.” Story continues Investors are waiting for the gathering of China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, in the coming weeks as it will need to approve any extra fiscal budget or bond quota. The Chinese equity market has been on a roller-coaster ride since late September, when a series of stimulus measures unleashed a burst of optimism that’s now cooling. As Beijing takes its time in detailing a fiscal spending plan, skepticism is growing about whether authorities are willing to deploy greater firepower to turn around the economy and markets. Also read: Chinese Stocks Slide Into Correction as Stimulus Hopes Wane At a derivatives trading forum in Hong Kong on Monday, Peter Yip, head of currencies and emerging markets at JPMorgan Chase Bank, said demand for China hedges has also increased given the outlook for interest-rate cuts globally. Plus, investors want to avoid a repeat of the boom-and-bust episode from 2015, when Chinese stocks spiraled out of control, reaching a seven-year high even as economic growth disappointed — a situation that’s unsustainable in the long run, Naeckter said. “There remains a healthy dose of skepticism, which is good in the sense that we may not get an overshoot on the upside,” he said. --With assistance from Sangmi Cha and Henry Ren.

Arm Holdings plc (ARM) Teams Up with Industry Leaders to Launch Advanced AI CPU Chiplet Platform for Cloud and HPC Applications Read full article Ghazal Ahmed Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 4:39 PM 6 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. S&P 500 to Reach 6,000 by Year-End Amid AI Boom and Earnings Growth Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs . Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

But there's another way to fly private that can be much more accessible: fractional ownership . This model allows companies or individuals to split "ownership" of a private plane by buying into a set amount of yearly hours and then paying the hourly rate when they fly. The operator covers ongoing costs like staffing and maintenance. This is the core business model of Flexjet, a US-based private aircraft operator with a fleet of more than 270 planes. It offers a range of options, including Embraer light jets, Sikorsky helicopters, Bombardier Challengers, and the ultra-long-range Gulfstream G650 . Among Flexjet's most recent additions to its US portfolio is the $23 million Embraer Praetor 600 . It's an improved variant of Embraer's Legacy fleet and builds on its Praetor 500 sister jet with ultramodern avionics, a larger cabin, and a longer range. Advertisement Business Insider toured a Flexjet Praetor 600 at Westchester County Airport in New York on Wednesday to see what it offers customers. Advertisement The Praetor 600 is part of Flexjet's "fractional jet ownership" program. The Praetor 600 is just one of hundreds of Flexjet's fractional owner planes. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Flexjet is the second-largest fractional ownership operator behind NetJets by share of flight hours. "It's like a country club; there's an initial buy-in to join, then there's a monthly due to cover the fixed cost of ownership, then there's the direct hourly operating cost when you go out to fly your hours," Anthony Sibilla, sales VP for Flexjet, told Business Insider during the tour. Flexjet's fractional ownership starts at 1/16, or 50 hours a year, and goes up to a half share, or 400 hours. So, instead of paying $23 million for the Praetor 600 plus all of the upkeep and operating expenses, buyers are paying a much smaller amount with up to 15 other customers. Advertisement Flexjet's fractional owners are 80% Fortune 500 companies and 20% high-net-worth people, Sibilla said. First launched in June 2019, the dual-engine Praetor lists for about $23 million. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Sibilla said the customers are very territory-specific. "The New York City area is a lot of private equity, real estate, and finance" companies, he said. "Houston is oil and gas; in the Bay Area, it's a lot of tech companies." South Florida's fractional jet ownership market historically included many New Yorkers who retired or had a second home in the state. More recently, customers have included companies like Citadel and Goldman Sachs that relocated to the Sunshine State during the pandemic, Sibilla said. Advertisement Buyers pay around $10,000 an hour to fly on the Praetor 600. Inside the Praetor 600. Taylor Rains/Business Insider $10,000 is expensive — it's more than three times the median mortgage payment in the US. But for wealthy fliers, it can cut some of the time, hassle, and inflexibility associated with commercial flying. Sibilla said the Flexjet's hourly rate, which he emphasized was a rough average, is the "all-in operating cost." This covers extras like fuel and the pro-rated monthly management fee , which includes costs such as maintenance and insurance. He said the company can guarantee the aircraft's availability within 10 hours. It also has another perk: fractional owners can be hard to track. Elon Musk, for example, has been vocal about jet trackers following his whereabouts . Apple CEO Tim Cook and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault only rent private planes due to security and privacy concerns. Advertisement Flexjet's Praetor 600 can fly up to about 4,600 miles, or nearly eight hours nonstop. Sibilla said customers use fractional ownership for both business and pleasure. Taylor Rains/Business Insider The super-midsized category jet is bigger and longer-ranged than the midsize Praetor 500 and is better suited for longer trips. It can connect cities like London and New York or São Paulo and Miami, flying about 700 miles further than its sister jet. In the US, Sibilla said Flexjet's Praetor 600 is frequently used between New York and Palm Beach in Florida, but leisure travelers also commonly fly it to ski destinations like Bozeman, Montana, and Aspen, Colorado. He said the Praetor 600's 150 cubic feet of storage can accommodate the snowboard and ski gear needed for these high-dollar vacations. Advertisement The plane can carry two pilots and up to nine passengers. Flexjet has an interior design center in Ohio. Taylor Rains/Business Insider There are six loungers and a three-person divan available on board, with two pilots in the cockpit. Sibilla said Flexjet has customized the interiors of its aircraft with different color schemes and designs to give its customers a homey environment and bridge the gap between fractional ownership and wholly owning the jet. Flexjet pilots are specific to the plane's tail number to further personalize the fractional experience, as well, he said. Advertisement The divan can be converted into a bed. Flyers have a lie-flat bed option on the Praetor 600. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Having a bed onboard can greatly increase the value of a larger plane like the Praetor 600, especially on transatlantic or cross-country routes. The individual lounges can also be adjusted into twin beds, but Sibilla said the seat's legrest and deep recline are often comfortable enough for flyers. Advertisement Customers can cater almost any food. Catering was set up to demonstrate part of a cabin server's job, though servers are not staffed on the Praetor 600. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Flexjet has a standardized menu but the company said it can accommodate customer requests — meaning anything from five-star luxury restaurants to McDonald's french fries. Customers can eat at the pull-out tables between each set of forward and aft loungers. Sibilla said some of its private planes, like the Gulfstream G450, automatically staff a "cabin server," which is Flexjet's term for a flight attendant. The Praetor 600 doesn't offer servers. Its galley has a convection oven and other equipment to prepare meals. Advertisement There is a lavatory and storage room in the back of the jet. The sink and mirror are opposite the toilet. Taylor Rains/Business Insider The bathroom was surprisingly chic, with woodlike finishes, a sink, a mirror, and even a window. The toilet's thick cushion cover is distinctive from commercial plane bathrooms. The storage room, accessible from the bathroom, can hold snacks, toiletries, and other items. Advertisement The cockpit has advanced avionics for safety and efficiency. The cockpit does not have a yoke. Taylor Rains/Business Insider The Praetor 600 has an advanced fly-by-wire system (meaning the pilot doesn't have a yoke) that is designed to make flying easier and less busy. The large cockpit screens aim to help with workflow and situational awareness. The Praetor 600 and its Praetor 500 sister jet have one of the world's best safety records, according to an analysis of safety records by charter broker Stratos Jet Charters. The plan also offers inflight WiFi, a DVD player, a sound system, and cabin controls for temperature and lighting. Advertisement Flyers can use a private terminal in some cities. Flexjet has private terminals at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, Dallas Love Field, and Van Nuys Airport near Los Angeles, and it plans to add more in Florida, Montana, and Arizona. Taylor Rains/Business Insider Private jet passengers can often avoid the hassle of airport security and instead fly out of private terminals. Flexjet has a handful of dedicated terminals, meaning in some cities, it doesn't share a space with competitor charter companies , flight schools, or other general aviation flights. This includes Westchester, where customers can have private meetings or enjoy a drink or sandwich in the lobby before a flight, or they can simply drive straight up to their plane on the tarmac. Flexjet also operates its own maintenance hangar at the airport. Advertisement It's easy to see the benefits of fractional ownership. The galley had plenty of storage and meal prep equipment. Taylor Rains/Business Insider It's hard not to see the appeal of fractional ownership. It offers privacy and convenience while avoiding all the leg work of fully owning a personal or corporate jet. And the hourly rate might make sense for corporate travel. A company flying nine people from New York to Florida might spend roughly $30,000 on the three-hour one-way flight, which is about $3,300 per person. A Delta Air Lines domestic first-class ticket on the same route in December ranges from $500 to $1,500 per seat. The Delta flight is still half the price or less overall, but wealthy fractional buyers may be willing to pay extra for the time savings, comfort, and peace of mind of a private plane — not to mention the potential tax benefits for business travel .

Advertisement In the valley below the Teton mountain range, some of the wealthiest people in America kick back on their terraces and look out at a vast mountain landscape where mansions are hidden in the towering evergreen trees. They have saunas in their houses and spend thousands on custom-made cowboy hats with diamond bands. I'm talking about the wealthy enclave of Jackson Hole in Teton County, Wyoming — one of the richest counties in the US. Jackson Hole has long been a billionaire hideout and the city with the most unequal income in the US . According to the Economic Policy Institute , the top 1% of residents in the metro area earn 132 times the income of the bottom 99% of residents. The average income of the top 1% sits above a cool $16 million. Advertisement A-listers from Kanye West and the Kardashians to Sandra Bullock and Harrison Ford have bought property in Jackson Hole. Still, I recently visited the city for the first time to see what makes this place so coveted for high earners. Advertisement Lower taxes and mountain views draw wealthy DINKs and boomers to Jackson Hole. Pedestrians stroll through Downtown Jackson. Joey Hadden/Business Insider From Texas to California, affluent Americans are buying up property in Jackson Hole, a luxurious Wyoming escape. The city has fewer than 11,000 residents where mansions dot mountain ranges, and a stroll downtown feels like the Wild West — if you ignore the hoodies, baseball caps, and automobiles. Jackson Hole real-estate agent Sam Haack told Business Insider that his clients are usually boomers or DINKs (dual-income, no kids). "The baby boomers have largely gained their wealth through their appreciation of assets over the years like their equity portfolios, other homes, and businesses," he said. "Some of these clients may still work W2 jobs in finance, consulting, or real estate but are usually business owners and entrepreneurs." Haack added that about 40% of his sales are for full-time residents, and the other 60% are second homes and investment properties. Sotheby's Jackson Hole-based real-estate agent Laurie Huff told BI that her clientele is similar. "Our clients in the past few years have ranged in age from 30 to 60 years and come from high-net-worth backgrounds," she said in a statement. "A finance/business background seems to account for a large percentage." She added that about half of her clients move in full-time. "Others stay for six-plus months and then spend part of the year in a warmer climate," she wrote. Advertisement Jackson Hole is located in Teton County, Wyoming. Jackson Hole is on the western edge of Wyoming. Google Maps Jackson Hole is a 60-mile-long valley in Teton County, Wyoming, that includes the towns of Jackson, Moose, Teton Village, and Wilson. Kelly is a small, census-designated place in the greater Jackson Hole area that's worth mentioning because it's home to the most expensive listing in Wyoming right now, a $65,000,000 luxury ranch. Advertisement Only 3% of the entire county can be built on — making the real estate inherently a buyer's market. A wealthy neighborhood in Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider According to Viehman Group's 2024 third-quarter Jackson Hole Real Estate report, the average price of a listing in the city over the last three months was $6.42 million. Today, the most expensive house on the market is a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home on more than 9,100 square feet that is listed at $40 million . "As a buyer, it is so competitive because of simple supply and demand," Haack told BI. "We have always had much more demand than supply because, well, it's one of the most beautiful places in the US, and the lifestyle is unmatched." The supply is very limited — only 3% of the county is private land that can be built on. "The rest is public land owned by the federal, state, or local governments," he added. Because of the scarcity of available land, Haack said buyers "tend to hang onto these properties for the appreciation and tax advantages, leading to even less inventory and supply." Advertisement I understood why millionaires want to live in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, before my plane even landed. A view from a plane descending into Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider As we put our seats in the upright position to prepare for landing on my flight to Jackson Hole, I looked out the window to see Grand Teton National Park from above. Mountain ranges went on for miles between valleys and bodies of water. It was one of the most epic views I've seen from a plane. People who live here get this view on every flight home into Jackson Hole Airport , one of the smallest and most luxurious in the country, located inside Teton National Park. It's so small that passengers enter and exit the plane from outside. When I stepped onto the tarmac, I was immediately taken by the freshness of the air. I smelled hints of pine trees as the wind blew through my hair. Before heading into the airport to exit, I spun around for a 360-degree view of the mountains. Advertisement The most developed part of the valley is the town of Jackson. Million Dollar Cowboy Bar is in Downtown Jackson. Joey Hadden/Business Insider Home to the famous Million Dollar Cowboy Bar , Jackson is a small town with shops, restaurants, and architecture reminiscent of the American West. When I visited, the downtown area was full of tourists, but retail seemed to cater to locals, too. There were home furniture and decor stores on every block. And I think tourists shouldn't miss the celebrity-loved, luxury cowboy hat store, Kemo Sabe. Staff members mold the hats and customize them with bands, features, and branding right in the store. Haack told BI that families tend to move to East Jackson, which is conveniently located near the town square. According to Sotheby's International Realty , the area has a mix of condos, townhouses, and single-family homes costing as much as $8.7 million. "You'll find young families that ride their e-bikes to work and to get ice cream in the summer," he said of the area. Advertisement From Wilson to Teton Village, the other parts of Jackson Hole are more remote — and expensive. A mansion sits on a hill in Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider The richest residents in Jackson Hole tend to live in the more remote areas around Jackson in the greater Jackson Hole region: Kelly, Moose, Teton Village, and Wilson. Haack told BI that Teton Village and Wilson typically have the largest and most expensive homes in Jackson Hole. "These two areas are popular due to their more quiet nature as well as being outside of the now traffic-filled town of Jackson," he added. Advertisement These homes can be up to three stories high and have stunning architecture, water features, and, of course, views. A mega mansion in Jackson Hole. Joey Hadden/Business Insider During my trip, I saw a mix of luxury cabins and modern mansions in these neighborhoods. "The two main categories of architecture we see in Jackson Hole are log cabin (old Jackson style) and Mountain Modern (new Jackson style)," Haack told BI. "Log cabins never go out of style but do require a lot more maintenance." I saw modern homes with mixed materials, sleek exteriors, flat roofs, and patios with water features like fountains and mini falls. I even went inside a mansion and found unique features — from an indoor sauna to a double-sided fireplace. Due to zoning constrictions, Jackson Hole's mega mansions can only be up to three stories tall, so many are sprawled out like ranches on vast properties. Advertisement It seems like no matter where the rich choose to live in Jackson, they have incredible views. Mountains are visible behind a street in Jackson.

The biotech company that helped usher in the era of consumer DNA test kits nearly two decades ago has faced several recent setbacks, including a class action lawsuit and user privacy concerns. A spokesperson for 23andMe told Business Insider in a statement that "the company's mission of helping people live longer, healthier lives through a preventive approach to health, and providing access to potentially life-changing genetic information, hasn't changed." Here is a timeline of the company's meteoric rise and steady fall. Advertisement 2006: 23andMe is founded in Silicon Valley 23andMe cofounder Anne Wojcicki. Kimberly White / Getty Images 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki co-founded the company in 2006 with biologist Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza, who previously worked at the now-defunct Perlegen Sciences, which was a biotech startup that studied human genomes. The company planted roots in Silicon Valley, where other startups like Twitter and YouTube were taking shape at the time. "The team of three worked out of a small office in Palo Alto, complete with an overcrowded, hardworking computer server room," a company blog post says. "Scientific rigor was top of mind; the co-founders spent their early days meeting with regulators, building a robust advisory committee, and figuring out how to give people direct access to their genetic information." Avey stepped down as co-president in 2009 and officially left the company in 2011. Cusenza departed in 2007. Advertisement 2007: 23andMe secures millions in funding from Google Google cofounder Sergey Brin and Wojcicki married in 2007. Donald Bowers/Getty Images for The Weinstein Company 23andMe quickly secured funding from several companies, including Google. A May 2007 SEC filing said Google invested $3.9 million into 23andMe, taking a minority interest. The filing also said Google cofounder Sergey Brin provided millions in interim debt financing to 23andMe. "Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe, Sergey provided approximately $2.6 million in interim debt financing to 23andMe, which was repaid as part of this financing transaction," the filing said. The funding coincided with Brin's marriage to Wojcicki that May. The pair, who share two children, divorced in 2015. Advertisement 2007: 23andMe launched its first product for $999 23andMe began selling its DNA saliva test to consumers in the United States in 2007. ERIC BARADAT/Getty Images 23andMe launched its first product — a DNA saliva test — for sale in the United States in November 2007. The company priced the product at $999. Users could access information about their risk for certain diseases, their ancestry, and their inherited traits. 23andMe provides data to users through a private online account. "We believe this information provides intriguing insights into an individual's genetics, with the goal of expanding the collective knowledge base by enabling active participation in research," Wojcicki told Reuters at the time. However, 23andMe's growing popularity didn't come without criticism. Some consumers were concerned about privacy related to their data and whether insurers could access it to deny coverage or discriminate against certain individuals. A 23andMe spokesperson told BI that user data is not shared with other entities unless given consent. "Beyond our contracted laboratory, with which we work to process a customer's sample and deliver their results, customer information will not be shared with any other entity unless they provide us with consent to do so," a statement said. The spokesperson added that 23andMe did not share user data with "employers, insurance companies, law enforcement agencies or any public databases." Advertisement 2008: Time Magazine named 23andMe's Personal Genome Service its Invention of the Year Time Magazine named 23andMe's Personal Genome Service its Invention of the Year in 2008. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Despite the privacy concerns, 23andMe began to gain recognition for the work of its researchers. Time Magazine named 23andMe's Personal Genome Service its Invention of the Year in 2008. "Although 23andMe isn't the only company selling DNA tests to the public, it does the best job of making them accessible and affordable," Time Magazine wrote. "We are at the beginning of a personal-genomics revolution that will transform not only how we take care of ourselves but also what we mean by personal information," Time wrote. "In the past, only élite researchers had access to their genetic fingerprints, but now personal genotyping is available to anyone who orders the service online and mails in a spit sample." The company slashed the price of its service from $999 to $399 that same year. Advertisement 2009: Google makes another multimillion-dollar investment in 23andMe Google invested in 23andMe on several occasions, including in 2009. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google invested $2.6 million in 23andMe again in June 2009, according to an SEC filing. The filing mentions Brin, who was still married to Wojcicki at the time. "Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe's Series B preferred stock financing, Sergey also invested approximately $10 million in 23andMe's convertible debt financing, which was converted into Series B preferred stock as part of this financing transaction," the filing said. Advertisement 2010: 23andMe gets its first National Health Institute-funded grant 23andMe secured a grant from the National Health Institute in 2010. Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images 23andMe launched its first National Health Institute-funded study in 2010 after securing a grant, the company announced at the time. Specifically, the company secured an NIH Small Business Innovative Research Grant to "validate our web-based approach to pharmacogenomics research." "The purpose of this first phase is similar to that of our first research publication: to demonstrate that we can replicate known genetic associations using the web-based survey data volunteered by our customers," 23andMe said in its announcement. The company would later receive more grants from the NIH, including about $1.4 million in 2014. That year, 23andMe published its first peer-reviewed study. Advertisement 2011: 23andMe secures almost $31 million in its third round of funding 23andMe's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The company announced in January 2011 that it raised $31 million during its third round of funding after securing an additional $9 million. MPM Capital and Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation became the newest investors in 23andMe. Advertisement 2012: 23andMe lowers its price to $99, making the product more accessible 23andMe slashed the price of its product to $99 in 2012, making it more accessible to consumers. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images The company reduced the cost of its service to $299 in May 2012 and again to $99 later that year . 23andMe said in December 2012 that it raised more than $50 million in another round of financing, which would help the company reach its goal of 1 million customers. Investors included Israeli entrepreneur Yuri Milner, Google Ventures, MPM Capital, Brin, and Wojcicki. At the time, the company only had about 180,000 customers. "The Series D investment, combined with rapidly decreasing costs associated with genetic testing technologies, enables 23andMe to reduce the price of its Personal Genome Service to $99, effective immediately," the company said. Advertisement 2013: FDA orders 23andMe to stop marketing its genetic health screening service The FDA told 23andMe to stop marketing its genetic health screening service in 2013. Andrew Harnik/AP Photo 23andMe found itself in trouble with the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013. The FDA instructed 23andMe to stop marketing its genetic health screening service in the United States until it completed the agency's regulatory review process. The company could continue selling its ancestry service. 23andMe complied with the FDA's request, meaning it only provided users with Ancestry reports and raw data. Wojcicki discussed the FDA's regulation during an appearance at the SXSW festival in 2014. "It has slowed up the number of people signing up," Wojcicki said, according to The Guardian. She added: "We are pioneers. We've had a lot of ups and downs but we have lots of tenacity to push on through. It will take time, money, and effort to figure out the path forward." The company met the FDA's standard in 2015. "The new 23andMe experience reflected almost two years of work with regulators, our scientists, medical experts, and product designers," the company said. "The result is the first direct-to-consumer test available directly to individuals in the United States that includes reports that meet FDA requirements for being scientifically and clinically valid."

Reuters/Jason Reed 23andMe continued to evolve its services, and in 2015, the FDA granted authorization to market its screening for Bloom syndrome , a rare genetic disorder, the company said at the time. "This is also the first time the FDA has granted authorization to market a direct-to-consumer genetic test, and it gives 23andMe a regulatory framework for future submissions," 23andMe said in a blog post. The FDA authorized additional reports following 2015, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 Select Variants.

Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for MAKERS The company had millions of users by 2019, showing significant growth since its launch. But demand began to wane that year as the 23andMe business model — which relied on one-time tests — faltered. Wojcicki echoed that sentiment in a comment to Business Insider, saying , "It's a new technology, and I think it's hit a lull." Wojcicki remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back, but 23andMe announced it was laying off 100 employees in January 2020 as sales were still down. The CEO told CNBC at the time that factors like privacy could remain a sore point. Another reason could be consumers' fear of an economic downturn, meaning the somewhat pricey test is less of a priority. Despite the downturn, 23andMe continued to collect investments. In December 2020, 23andMe raised almost $82.5 million in equity funding. Advertisement 2021: 23andMe goes public and reaches a valuation of over $6 billion 23andMe went public in 2021. Spencer Platt/Getty Images 23andMe went public in June 2021 at $11.13 a share, marking a victory for the company after struggling with sales. Before going public, the company completed a reverse merger with Richard Branson's VG Acquisition . Wojcicki told Business Insider at the time that her "priority is really the long term." "The short term is obviously important for a lot of people, but everything that I do is focused on the long term. I've only looked at my stock price because I've been doing the news articles and people keep showing it to me," she said. The company's valuation peaked at $6 billion . Advertisement 2023: Some 23andMe user accounts are compromised Some 23andMe users' accounts were compromised in October 2023. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Concerns about privacy always plagued 23andMe, but those concerns grew after news broke last year that some user data had been compromised. The data — including birth details and names — was sold on the dark web by hackers. 23andMe confirmed that ancestry data for nearly 7 million users were accessed that December. A data breach notification filing in January 2024 said it took 23andMe five months to realize the data had been accessed. The incident led to a class action lawsuit, which 23andMe settled for $30 million in September, according to Reuters. The company also said in SEC filings it laid off more employees in 2023, including that June when it reduced its workforce by 9%. 23andMe laid off another 71 employees in August 2023, according to filings.

Google Finance Independent directors on 23andMe's board announced their resignations in a September letter addressed to Wojcicki. Although the independent directors said they "wholeheartedly support" the company's mission, they took issue with the current business strategy. "It is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward," the letter said. "Because of that difference and because of your concentrated voting power, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders that we resign from the Board rather than have a protracted and distracting difference of view with you as to the direction of the Company." Advertisement 2024: Wojcicki responds to consumer concerns Wojcicki said she would not consider "third-party takeover proposals." Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch The company's reputation took another hit in September when an SEC filing said Wojcicki "would be open to considering third-party takeover proposals."

Michael writes on high income assets that help people retire early. Following Oct 20, 2024, 09:59am EDT Updated Oct 20, 2024, 10:35am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Strengthening and building your savings getty Last year, the White House published a blog post titled “As the US Consumer Goes, So Goes the US Economy.” No matter what your politics are, I think we can all agree that America’s economy depends on consumers buying things. For us income investors, then, the consumer’s health is a key thing to watch, as it ultimately sets the direction of stocks. So how healthy is the US consumer today, and can we confidently buy stocks—and better still, high-yielding CEFs like the one we’ll talk about below (current yield: 10%)? Often, the signals are murky. America is, after all, a big country with a lot of people in it, and some of those people are obviously doing better than others, so it’s tricky to zero in on the overall health of consumers. Still, there are some things every consumer is sensitive to and, ultimately, will affect everyone’s spending. The biggest variable, as you can likely guess, is inflation. Inflation/SPY Ycharts In 2021, as we all know well, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (in orange above) started climbing. That caused stocks to tank in 2022, as spiraling prices of everyday things forced pretty well everyone, no matter how rich, to cut back to varying degrees. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor But see how the orange line kept going down? The CPI is now back around pre-pandemic levels. With that in mind, you’d expect US consumers to boost their spending again. And they have. Fun Spending Ycharts This is an obscure metric, but it’s important: how much Americans spend on recreation services (think movie tickets, concerts, hotels, amusement parks and such). After the pandemic slump, inflation slowed the recovery to the pre-pandemic trendline in 2021 and 2022. Growth recovered in 2023 and has kept strengthening so far in 2024. In short, Americans have more money to spend on fun because 2022’s inflationary pressures have started to ebb. Here’s another interesting chart on the health of the consumer: Household Debt/Income Apollo Global Management What this shows us is that, if you take the average US household and count up its debt, the total amounts to less than 100% of their disposable (or after-tax) income. In other words, putting 100% of that income toward their debt could erase their borrowings in less than a year (which is obviously impossible but useful for context here). Contrast that with other wealthy nations, like Canada and Australia, where households would need a year and 10 months. Combine healthy US household balance sheets and higher spending on recreation and it’s hard to conclude that, generally speaking, the US consumer is anything but healthy. How to Profit A strong consumer means a strong economy and strong corporate earnings. That, in turn, translates to larger returns to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. A Rising Tide of S&P 500 Dividends and Buybacks In 2023, S&P 500 firms spent over $800 billion buying back shares from investors, while giving them over $500 billion in cash dividends. You can be one of the people getting a “paycheck” from companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V) when you invest in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ) . But don’t expect that to turn into a big cash flow overnight. With SPY yielding just 1.2%, even a million dollars in this fund won’t replace more than $1,000 per month in income—hardly a living wage! But we can speed that up without sacrificing quality if we instead buy a fund like the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) , one of my favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) . USA invests in US mid-cap and large-cap firms: Its portfolio holds Apple, Microsoft, Visa and many other top S&P 500 names. While its holdings resemble those of SPY, its dividend does not . USA turns gains and dividends from the stocks it holds into an income stream for investors, which is how it can pay out a far bigger dividend than SPY: 10%, to be exact. Based on USA’s yield (note that its payout does fluctuate a bit, based on the fund’s portfolio returns), a million-dollar portfolio now pays $8,333 averaged out on a monthly basis—higher than the average American’s paycheck. But will the income stream hold? A 10% yield seems unrealistically high, which is why a lot of people scoff when I show them facts like these. So let’s look at history. USA Dividend Ycharts USA’s payout has steadily risen with the stock market over the last decade. As long as consumers have money to spend, giving companies revenue they can translate into profits for their shareholders, USA will be able to pump that dividend number up further. Finally, let’s talk about USA’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio). As I write this, the fund trades just a hair over par. While we prefer discounted CEFs, that’s reasonable for USA, given its strong management and outsized yield. We’ve also seen the fund trade at healthy premiums (north of 4%) as recently as July 2023. Nonetheless, if you prefer to buy at a discount, I get it. In that case, go ahead and put USA on your watch list. Given the fund’s very slight premium, it wouldn’t take much to push it back into discount territory. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook .

Should Weakness in SSE plc's (LON:SSE) Stock Be Seen As A Sign That Market Will Correct The Share Price Given Decent Financials? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 8:54 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: SSE (LON:SSE) has had a rough month with its share price down 4.6%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on SSE's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for SSE How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for SSE is: 16% = UK£1.9b ÷ UK£12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated £0.16 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. SSE's Earnings Growth And 16% ROE To start with, SSE's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that SSE's net income shrunk at a rate of 5.8% over the past five years. Therefore, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures. So, as a next step, we compared SSE's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 11% over the last few years. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is SSE worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether SSE is currently mispriced by the market. Story continues Is SSE Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 39% (or a retention ratio of 61%) which is pretty normal, SSE's declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating. Moreover, SSE has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 39% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that SSE's future ROE will be 16% which is again, similar to the current ROE. Conclusion In total, it does look like SSE has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK): Among the Best US Stocks for Foreign Investors Right Now Read full article Maham Fatima Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 8:00 PM 8 min read Link Copied 1 In this article: We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best US Stocks For Foreign Investors Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other US stocks. Optimism Amid Market Strength Despite previous recession predictions, the market has shown resilience and continued to rise, largely due to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. Current market valuations are trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle, raising questions about future earnings growth. There seems to be a disconnect between expectations for significant easing and projected strong earnings growth. Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant and consider the evolving economic landscape as they navigate potential market shifts. Earlier in October, Jason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now. We covered his opinion in our article about the 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now in much more detail. Here's an excerpt from that discussion: “Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then. ....He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect. ...Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.” On October 16, J.J. Kinahan, IG North America CEO, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to discuss the latest market trends, highlighting that he has never seen investors this afraid of a market that's doing so well. J.J. Kinahan noted that the upcoming weeks would be particularly interesting due to the convergence of earnings reports and the impending election, alongside uncertainty surrounding the Fed's next moves. He remarked on the market's resilience, highlighting that there have been 46 new highs for the S&P 500 this year, despite a general sentiment of skepticism among investors. He expressed that it is unusual for a market to perform so well while simultaneously being viewed with caution and fear. Story continues Kinahan pointed out that many investors are hesitant, particularly those in their mid-30s and younger, who have not experienced a significant downturn in the market. He explained that this demographic often perceives any market decline as temporary, lasting only a few days. He emphasized the importance of taking risks when young and noted that many younger investors are excited about their opportunities in the current market environment. This positive sentiment is particularly significant given their parents' experiences during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. He also speculated that part of the reason for the market's strong performance might be attributed to older investors who have been burned in previous downturns and are now waiting for a pullback that has yet to materialize. Kinahan suggested that as these investors gradually capitulate, they may start to invest more actively in the market. Discussing interest rates, Kinahan acknowledged that while the Fed is in a massive easing cycle, there seems to be a disconnect with the bond market recently. He mentioned a study indicating that volatility during election years is not significantly greater than in non-election years. Currently, volatility is relatively low, hovering around a historical average of 20, and only recently rising to this level. He explained that typically, volatility tends to increase after elections, when political changes begin to take effect and policies, are implemented. He anticipated that January would bring more clarity regarding how these changes might impact the markets. Kinahan's insights reflect a complex interplay between investor sentiment, market performance, and external economic factors as they navigate through earnings season and an election year. His perspective underscores a cautious optimism about the market's ability to maintain its upward trajectory despite prevailing uncertainties. Methodology To find the best US stocks for foreign investors, we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite and that analysts were bullish on. We then selected the top 8 stocks with the highest average analysts' upside potential. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their average analysts' upside potential, as of October 16. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Merck secured FDA approval and ACIP recommendation for its new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, CAPVAXIVE, for adults. Additionally, WINREVAIR, a vaccine for adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, was approved and generated over $70 million in sales during the quarter. The company expanded its presence in animal health by acquiring Elanco's aqua business and entered the ophthalmology market through the acquisition of EyeBio, aiming to develop treatments for retinal conditions. As October began, it completed the acquisition of CN201, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell-associated diseases. It's being investigated in clinical trials for NHL and ALL. The company's CAPVAXIVE, a new Pneumococcal 21-valent Conjugate Vaccine, is showing promising results in protecting adults from pneumococcal disease. The vaccine demonstrated strong immune responses and was well-tolerated in clinical trials. It is designed to cover a broader range of pneumococcal serotypes than existing vaccines, providing additional protection for adults at high risk. It’s poised for continued growth due to its international expansion, diverse drug portfolio, and strong financial results. The acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics is expected to strengthen its oncology pipeline and create opportunities for new combination therapies. Hence, Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is rather well-positioned for success. Oakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2024 investor letter : “Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global pharmaceutical firm with leading oncology, vaccine and animal health franchises. Premier products in Merck’s portfolio include Keytruda, Gardasil, Winrevair and Bravecto. Outsized contributor Keytruda is an immuno-oncology drug that treats several cancers and tumors. Keytruda is an astounding clinical and commercial success that is on track to become one of the best-selling prescription drugs to date. Investor angst surrounding Keytruda’s pending U.S. patent expiration in 2028 presented a chance to buy shares at a discounted valuation. We believe opportunities to extend Keytruda’s duration through life cycle management are underappreciated. More importantly, discounted cash flows from products already on market cover today’s entire stock price, meaning there is minimal value ascribed to a promising pipeline with strong sales potential. We believe Merck is led by a capable management team that looks to reinvest these cash flows in an accretive manner.” Overall MRK ranks 2nd on our list of the best US stocks for foreign investors right now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of MRK, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock .

[+] bills in this arranged photograph on 01 November 2017, in Hong Kong, China. The electronic coin that was introduced in January 2009 and now trades and is regulated like oil and gold, has been surging since the start of 2016 to over US$6000. (Photo by studioEAST/Getty Images) Getty Images Everyone knows that Bitcoin represents an entirely new foundation for a new financial system, displacing the old. The legacy financial system knows this, and they are racing to shift their business models, production functions, and human capital onto Bitcoin. Some of this will be straightforward, like Visa operating credit cards on top of Bitcoin, asset managers like Fidelity who allow its clients to custody Bitcoin, and international money transmittal services like Western Union that will integrate with Lightning. Tilting the legacy financial system onto Bitcoin is becoming the new conventional wisdom. But this is not, in my mind, the most radical impact that Bitcoin will have on traditional finance. Rather, it will transform traditional money management. Today, active money management is still a huge industry, even despite the rise of algorithmic trading and passive investments. Ultimately, the world cannot be 100% passive, because someone still needs to set the market price. Today, that share is quite large and continues to attract huge pools of capital and talent. Bitcoin will establish a new hurdle rate, far above the current market benchmark of 8%, the historical return to U.S. equities. Suppliers of capital, like the limited partners who capitalize investment managers today, will ask a simple question. Should I pay the high “2 and 20” fees for an active manager of equities, or simply park it in Bitcoin with an annual return that exceeds 90% of money managers today? I predict two possible changes to the industry once suppliers of capital ask that question. First, traditional money management as we know it today will diminish. This includes long-short equity hedge funds, multi-strategy hedge funds, dedicated bond funds, and high-frequency trading companies. It is naive to believe that money management will vanish altogether, because the financial markets will always offer outsized returns to the winners, and the best talent will secure those outsized returns and attract the most capital. Bitcoin just raises the bar, so beating the market will now mean beating Bitcoin. Second, the new money management will involve derivatives and speculation on top of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's volatility will slowly erode over time, as it has already. But any time there is any volatility, there are gains from trade, so future money managers will be Bitcoin aware. As the Bitcoin economy grows, the next Warren Buffett will be skilled in deciding which Bitcoin bank or which Bitcoin insurance company to capitalize, while the next Ken Griffin will decide how to allocate capital between Bitcoin, Bitcoin futures, and the new array of companies that adopt a Bitcoin standard for their corporate treasury.

Tribune Resources (ASX:TBR) Has Some Difficulty Using Its Capital Effectively Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 12:06 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 In this article: When it comes to investing, there are some useful financial metrics that can warn us when a business is potentially in trouble. Businesses in decline often have two underlying trends, firstly, a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining base of capital employed. This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. So after we looked into Tribune Resources ( ASX:TBR ), the trends above didn't look too great. What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Tribune Resources: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.047 = AU$14m ÷ (AU$313m - AU$18m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024) . So, Tribune Resources has an ROCE of 4.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Metals and Mining industry average of 10%. See our latest analysis for Tribune Resources roce While the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings , check out these free graphs detailing revenue and cash flow performance of Tribune Resources . What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Tribune Resources. About five years ago, returns on capital were 54%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Tribune Resources to turn into a multi-bagger. On a side note, Tribune Resources has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 5.8% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. The Key Takeaway In summary, it's unfortunate that Tribune Resources is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last five years have experienced a 30% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere. Story continues Tribune Resources does have some risks, we noticed 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about. While Tribune Resources isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets. Have feedback on this article?

I am the CIO of KraneShares, a China-focused ETF provider. Following Oct 21, 2024, 02:04pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CLN KraneShares Key News Asian equities were mixed overnight as Mainland China outperformed and the US dollar strengthened. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s central bank, cut the 1 and 5-year loan prime rates (LPRs) more aggressively than expected. The cut to both was 25 basis points, versus market expectations of 20, to 3.10% and 3.60%, respectively, from 3.35% and 3.85%. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng stated last week that they would cut the LPR by 25 basis points, but not one economist changed their forecast. He also stated they would cut the bank reserve requirement ratio (RRR), the amount of capital that banks must keep on their balance sheets rather than lend out, before year-end, which we all should assume will happen. Also helping mainland sentiment was news that three companies have tapped bank loan lines to buy back shares, including Sungrow and Sinopec, which were among the first movers, with loan amounts of approximately RMB 700 million each. This is a very positive sign as companies have been reluctant to increase borrowing throughout the current easing cycle. Mainland markets were led higher by growth stocks and sectors as well as small caps. We did not receive the date nor the agenda for the National People’s Congress (NPC) meetings. as hoped over the weekend, which is disappointing. Profit taking, adjusting positions going into earnings season, and the looming US Presidential election weighed on sentiment offshore as popular growth stocks and sectors underperformed. Many investors appear to be taking President Trump’s campaign rhetoric as economic reality, though we believe this is the “Art of the Deal”, i.e. a proposed negotiation tactic, which tracks from the previous Trump Administration, which cut tariff rates in half upon the signing of the “Phase One” trade agreement. If Trump’s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese imports were to be a reality, what would the consequence be on US inflation and the profits of Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot, and Costco? Everyone assumes the tariffs are only bad for China, as though US companies were immune.

Given the same piece of information, foreign investors sold while domestic investors bought. In fact, domestic investors were more than happy to buy the Hong Kong shares sold by foreign investors, based on the healthy $1.60 billion worth of net buying in Hong Kong by Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. After the close, Ping An’s results looked good though CATL missed. It is a busy week for Hong Kong stocks reporting, including Sands China, which reports today, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Sinopharm on Wednesday.

Main Board short turnover increased +17% from Friday, which is 107% of the 1-year average, as 11% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). Value and small caps fell less than growth and large caps. Materials and Real Estate gained +0.72% and +0.67%, the top-performers, while Communication Services fell -2.44%, Consumer Discretionary fell -2.36%, and Energy fell -1.76%. The only positive subsectors were materials and capital goods. Meanwhile, software, retail, and consumer services were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were high, at 2X the average, as Mainland investors bought a healthy net $1.6 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, SMIC, Xiaomi, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which all saw large net buys. Meanwhile, Meituan and Tencent small net buys and Alibaba was a small net sell.

The biotech company that helped usher in the era of consumer DNA test kits nearly two decades ago has faced several recent setbacks, including a class action lawsuit and user privacy concerns. A spokesperson for 23andMe told Business Insider in a statement that "the company's mission of helping people live longer, healthier lives through a preventive approach to health, and providing access to potentially life-changing genetic information, hasn't changed." Here is a timeline of the company's meteoric rise and steady fall. Advertisement 2006: 23andMe is founded in Silicon Valley 23andMe cofounder Anne Wojcicki. Kimberly White / Getty Images 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki co-founded the company in 2006 with biologist Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza, who previously worked at the now-defunct Perlegen Sciences, which was a biotech startup that studied human genomes. The company planted roots in Silicon Valley, where other startups like Twitter and YouTube were taking shape at the time. "The team of three worked out of a small office in Palo Alto, complete with an overcrowded, hardworking computer server room," a company blog post says. "Scientific rigor was top of mind; the co-founders spent their early days meeting with regulators, building a robust advisory committee, and figuring out how to give people direct access to their genetic information." Avey stepped down as co-president in 2009 and officially left the company in 2011. Cusenza departed in 2007. Advertisement 2007: 23andMe secures millions in funding from Google Google cofounder Sergey Brin and Wojcicki married in 2007. Donald Bowers/Getty Images for The Weinstein Company 23andMe quickly secured funding from several companies, including Google. A May 2007 SEC filing said Google invested $3.9 million into 23andMe, taking a minority interest. The filing also said Google cofounder Sergey Brin provided millions in interim debt financing to 23andMe. "Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe, Sergey provided approximately $2.6 million in interim debt financing to 23andMe, which was repaid as part of this financing transaction," the filing said. The funding coincided with Brin's marriage to Wojcicki that May. The pair, who share two children, divorced in 2015. Advertisement 2007: 23andMe launched its first product for $999 23andMe began selling its DNA saliva test to consumers in the United States in 2007. ERIC BARADAT/Getty Images 23andMe launched its first product — a DNA saliva test — for sale in the United States in November 2007. The company priced the product at $999. Users could access information about their risk for certain diseases, their ancestry, and their inherited traits. 23andMe provides data to users through a private online account. "We believe this information provides intriguing insights into an individual's genetics, with the goal of expanding the collective knowledge base by enabling active participation in research," Wojcicki told Reuters at the time. However, 23andMe's growing popularity didn't come without criticism. Some consumers were concerned about privacy related to their data and whether insurers could access it to deny coverage or discriminate against certain individuals. A 23andMe spokesperson told BI that user data is not shared with other entities unless given consent. "Beyond our contracted laboratory, with which we work to process a customer's sample and deliver their results, customer information will not be shared with any other entity unless they provide us with consent to do so," a statement said. The spokesperson added that 23andMe did not share user data with "employers, insurance companies, law enforcement agencies or any public databases."

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Despite the privacy concerns, 23andMe began to gain recognition for the work of its researchers. Time Magazine named 23andMe's Personal Genome Service its Invention of the Year in 2008. "Although 23andMe isn't the only company selling DNA tests to the public, it does the best job of making them accessible and affordable," Time Magazine wrote. "We are at the beginning of a personal-genomics revolution that will transform not only how we take care of ourselves but also what we mean by personal information," Time wrote. "In the past, only élite researchers had access to their genetic fingerprints, but now personal genotyping is available to anyone who orders the service online and mails in a spit sample." The company slashed the price of its service from $999 to $399 that same year. Advertisement 2009: Google makes another multimillion-dollar investment in 23andMe Google invested in 23andMe on several occasions, including in 2009. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google invested $2.6 million in 23andMe again in June 2009, according to an SEC filing. The filing mentions Brin, who was still married to Wojcicki at the time. "Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe's Series B preferred stock financing, Sergey also invested approximately $10 million in 23andMe's convertible debt financing, which was converted into Series B preferred stock as part of this financing transaction," the filing said. Advertisement 2010: 23andMe gets its first National Health Institute-funded grant 23andMe secured a grant from the National Health Institute in 2010. Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images 23andMe launched its first National Health Institute-funded study in 2010 after securing a grant, the company announced at the time. Specifically, the company secured an NIH Small Business Innovative Research Grant to "validate our web-based approach to pharmacogenomics research." "The purpose of this first phase is similar to that of our first research publication: to demonstrate that we can replicate known genetic associations using the web-based survey data volunteered by our customers," 23andMe said in its announcement. The company would later receive more grants from the NIH, including about $1.4 million in 2014. That year, 23andMe published its first peer-reviewed study. Advertisement 2011: 23andMe secures almost $31 million in its third round of funding 23andMe's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The company announced in January 2011 that it raised $31 million during its third round of funding after securing an additional $9 million. MPM Capital and Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation became the newest investors in 23andMe. Advertisement 2012: 23andMe lowers its price to $99, making the product more accessible 23andMe slashed the price of its product to $99 in 2012, making it more accessible to consumers. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images The company reduced the cost of its service to $299 in May 2012 and again to $99 later that year . 23andMe said in December 2012 that it raised more than $50 million in another round of financing, which would help the company reach its goal of 1 million customers. Investors included Israeli entrepreneur Yuri Milner, Google Ventures, MPM Capital, Brin, and Wojcicki. At the time, the company only had about 180,000 customers. "The Series D investment, combined with rapidly decreasing costs associated with genetic testing technologies, enables 23andMe to reduce the price of its Personal Genome Service to $99, effective immediately," the company said. Advertisement 2013: FDA orders 23andMe to stop marketing its genetic health screening service The FDA told 23andMe to stop marketing its genetic health screening service in 2013. Andrew Harnik/AP Photo 23andMe found itself in trouble with the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013. The FDA instructed 23andMe to stop marketing its genetic health screening service in the United States until it completed the agency's regulatory review process. The company could continue selling its ancestry service. 23andMe complied with the FDA's request, meaning it only provided users with Ancestry reports and raw data. Wojcicki discussed the FDA's regulation during an appearance at the SXSW festival in 2014. "It has slowed up the number of people signing up," Wojcicki said, according to The Guardian. She added: "We are pioneers. We've had a lot of ups and downs but we have lots of tenacity to push on through. It will take time, money, and effort to figure out the path forward." The company met the FDA's standard in 2015. "The new 23andMe experience reflected almost two years of work with regulators, our scientists, medical experts, and product designers," the company said. "The result is the first direct-to-consumer test available directly to individuals in the United States that includes reports that meet FDA requirements for being scientifically and clinically valid." Advertisement 2015: The FDA authorizes 23andMe to market the Bloom syndrome carrier status report The FDA headquarters. Reuters/Jason Reed 23andMe continued to evolve its services, and in 2015, the FDA granted authorization to market its screening for Bloom syndrome , a rare genetic disorder, the company said at the time. "This is also the first time the FDA has granted authorization to market a direct-to-consumer genetic test, and it gives 23andMe a regulatory framework for future submissions," 23andMe said in a blog post. The FDA authorized additional reports following 2015, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 Select Variants. Advertisement 2019: 23andMe slashes its workforce as consumers lose interest in DNA test kits Wojcicki said the consumer DNA test kit industry faced a lull in 2019. Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for MAKERS The company had millions of users by 2019, showing significant growth since its launch. But demand began to wane that year as the 23andMe business model — which relied on one-time tests — faltered. Wojcicki echoed that sentiment in a comment to Business Insider, saying , "It's a new technology, and I think it's hit a lull." Wojcicki remained optimistic that the industry would bounce back, but 23andMe announced it was laying off 100 employees in January 2020 as sales were still down. The CEO told CNBC at the time that factors like privacy could remain a sore point. Another reason could be consumers' fear of an economic downturn, meaning the somewhat pricey test is less of a priority. Despite the downturn, 23andMe continued to collect investments. In December 2020, 23andMe raised almost $82.5 million in equity funding. Advertisement 2021: 23andMe goes public and reaches a valuation of over $6 billion 23andMe went public in 2021. Spencer Platt/Getty Images 23andMe went public in June 2021 at $11.13 a share, marking a victory for the company after struggling with sales. Before going public, the company completed a reverse merger with Richard Branson's VG Acquisition . Wojcicki told Business Insider at the time that her "priority is really the long term." "The short term is obviously important for a lot of people, but everything that I do is focused on the long term. I've only looked at my stock price because I've been doing the news articles and people keep showing it to me," she said. The company's valuation peaked at $6 billion . Advertisement 2023: Some 23andMe user accounts are compromised Some 23andMe users' accounts were compromised in October 2023. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Concerns about privacy always plagued 23andMe, but those concerns grew after news broke last year that some user data had been compromised. The data — including birth details and names — was sold on the dark web by hackers. 23andMe confirmed that ancestry data for nearly 7 million users were accessed that December. A data breach notification filing in January 2024 said it took 23andMe five months to realize the data had been accessed. The incident led to a class action lawsuit, which 23andMe settled for $30 million in September, according to Reuters. The company also said in SEC filings it laid off more employees in 2023, including that June when it reduced its workforce by 9%. 23andMe laid off another 71 employees in August 2023, according to filings. Advertisement 2024: 23andMe's board of independent directors resigns A screenshot showing 23andMe's declining stock. Google Finance Independent directors on 23andMe's board announced their resignations in a September letter addressed to Wojcicki. Although the independent directors said they "wholeheartedly support" the company's mission, they took issue with the current business strategy. "It is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward," the letter said. "Because of that difference and because of your concentrated voting power, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders that we resign from the Board rather than have a protracted and distracting difference of view with you as to the direction of the Company." Advertisement 2024: Wojcicki responds to consumer concerns Wojcicki said she would not consider "third-party takeover proposals." Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch The company's reputation took another hit in September when an SEC filing said Wojcicki "would be open to considering third-party takeover proposals."

The U.S. Consumer Is Healthy And This 10% Dividend Will Profit BETA This is a BETA experience. opt-out here Money Investing The U.S. Consumer Is Healthy And This 10% Dividend Will Profit By Michael Foster Contributor Michael writes on high income assets that help people retire early. Following Oct 20, 2024, 09:59am EDT Save Article Comment Strengthening and building your savings getty Last year, the White House published a blog post titled “As the US Consumer Goes, So Goes the US Economy.” No matter what your politics are, I think we can all agree that America’s economy depends on consumers buying things. For us income investors, then, the consumer’s health is a key thing to watch, as it ultimately sets the direction of stocks. So how healthy is the US consumer today, and can we confidently buy stocks—and better still, high-yielding CEFs like the one we’ll talk about below (current yield: 10%)? Often, the signals are murky. America is, after all, a big country with a lot of people in it, and some of those people are obviously doing better than others, so it’s tricky to zero in on the overall health of consumers. Still, there are some things every consumer is sensitive to and, ultimately, will affect everyone’s spending. The biggest variable, as you can likely guess, is inflation. Inflation/SPY Ycharts In 2021, as we all know well, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (in orange above) started climbing. That caused stocks to tank in 2022, as spiraling prices of everyday things forced pretty well everyone, no matter how rich, to cut back to varying degrees. But see how the orange line kept going down? The CPI is now back around pre-pandemic levels. With that in mind, you’d expect US consumers to boost their spending again. And they have. Fun Spending Ycharts This is an obscure metric, but it’s important: how much Americans spend on recreation services (think movie tickets, concerts, hotels, amusement parks and such). Read More: 2 Huge, Tax-Free Dividends That Protect You From A Market Crash After the pandemic slump, inflation slowed the recovery to the pre-pandemic trendline in 2021 and 2022. Growth recovered in 2023 and has kept strengthening so far in 2024. In short, Americans have more money to spend on fun because 2022’s inflationary pressures have started to ebb. Here’s another interesting chart on the health of the consumer: Household Debt/Income Apollo Global Management What this shows us is that, if you take the average US household and count up its debt, the total amounts to less than 100% of their disposable (or after-tax) income. In other words, putting 100% of that income toward their debt could erase their borrowings in less than a year (which is obviously impossible but useful for context here). Contrast that with other wealthy nations, like Canada and Australia, where households would need a year and 10 months. Combine healthy US household balance sheets and higher spending on recreation and it’s hard to conclude that, generally speaking, the US consumer is anything but healthy. How to Profit A strong consumer means a strong economy and strong corporate earnings. That, in turn, translates to larger returns to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. A Rising Tide of S&P 500 Dividends and Buybacks In 2023, S&P 500 firms spent over $800 billion buying back shares from investors, while giving them over $500 billion in cash dividends. You can be one of the people getting a “paycheck” from companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V) when you invest in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ) . But don’t expect that to turn into a big cash flow overnight. With SPY yielding just 1.2%, even a million dollars in this fund won’t replace more than $1,000 per month in income—hardly a living wage! But we can speed that up without sacrificing quality if we instead buy a fund like the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) , one of my favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) . USA invests in US mid-cap and large-cap firms: Its portfolio holds Apple, Microsoft, Visa and many other top S&P 500 names. While its holdings resemble those of SPY, its dividend does not . USA turns gains and dividends from the stocks it holds into an income stream for investors, which is how it can pay out a far bigger dividend than SPY: 10%, to be exact. Based on USA’s yield (note that its payout does fluctuate a bit, based on the fund’s portfolio returns), a million-dollar portfolio now pays $8,333 averaged out on a monthly basis—higher than the average American’s paycheck. But will the income stream hold? A 10% yield seems unrealistically high, which is why a lot of people scoff when I show them facts like these. So let’s look at history. USA Dividend Ycharts USA’s payout has steadily risen with the stock market over the last decade. As long as consumers have money to spend, giving companies revenue they can translate into profits for their shareholders, USA will be able to pump that dividend number up further. Finally, let’s talk about USA’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio). As I write this, the fund trades just a hair over par. While we prefer discounted CEFs, that’s reasonable for USA, given its strong management and outsized yield. We’ve also seen the fund trade at healthy premiums (north of 4%) as recently as July 2023. Nonetheless, if you prefer to buy at a discount, I get it. In that case, go ahead and put USA on your watch list. Given the fund’s very slight premium, it wouldn’t take much to push it back into discount territory. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook .

[+] over black background. 3D illustration. getty Participants in the initial wave of tax credit transfer transactions filed their returns reflecting those deals on October 15, marking another milestone for the Inflation Reduction Act’s experiment in tax credit transfers. At least for some credit buyers, the tax system is inching closer to the inevitable: audits. In the due diligence they performed before the transfers, participants began preparing for examinations. The diligence process for tax credit transfers will likely always be at least partly customized to the parties because different entities have different concerns, but a more standardized roadmap has emerged over the past year or so as advisers and tax credit buyers and sellers gained experience. Doing Your Homework The basic outlines of the diligence process were informed in part by the precursor to transfers — tax equity. But the IRA clearly conceived of a transfer as a far simpler transaction, and accordingly they require less diligence. Consensus among buyers and sellers about how much less has evolved over time. The natural processes of maturation and acceptance of common diligence practices have made negotiations over due diligence more streamlined, said David Burton of Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP. “Now there are typically only a handful of issues to negotiate,” he said, adding that some buyers still do more due diligence than they need to out of an abundance of caution. The due diligence required for a transfer is focused on ensuring that the project can continue to operate economically in order to avoid a recapture event or a disallowance of credits, said Billy Lee of Reunion, an energy tax credit marketplace. Unlike in tax equity and secured financing deals, investor returns aren’t dependent on cash flows of the project in transfers, hence less diligence. The relative simplicity of transfers is a large part of their appeal. MORE FOR YOU Surprise Elon Musk Endorsement Suddenly Sends Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Higher Comet Tracker Tonight: When And Where To See It On Monday With ‘Shooting Stars’ NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Monday, October 21st “Transferees want to buy credits and never think about them again — that’s an ideal outcome of a tax credit purchase,” Lee noted. However, there are several areas where the tax credit buyer is exposed to some operational risk: avoiding recapture and complying with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Some deals require the seller to provide an annual compliance certificate to the buyer, but avoiding recapture and complying with the labor requirements are largely the project developer’s purview. Recapture, a scary possibility for transferees because it has high consequence, is very unlikely to happen, Lee said. If it does, the developer must notify the buyer so they can reflect that on their tax return and seek indemnification or make an insurance claim. Typical transfer agreements require transferors to comply with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship rules for alterations and repairs. Prospective credit buyers and sellers increasingly try to ensure that the information they need for due diligence is prepared and vetted as they go into negotiations, said Anand Chaturvedi of Dili. Chaturvedi’s company automates the data and file processing that has traditionally been done manually in the due diligence stage of transactions and provides diligence reports that are based on complete data, rather than sampling, to identify risks. Chaturvedi added that collecting and processing diligence information before negotiations not only makes them go more smoothly but also helps to ensure that the data is available for a later examination by the IRS. “Part of our involvement in these deals is to make all of the documentation as robust as possible for audit,” he said. Market Maturation Due diligence may never be fully uniform for all transactions, but as the number of completed deals climbs, the process has become more efficient. “There is now a better appreciation for the scope of diligence on both sides. Buyers understand that they don’t need everything, and sellers understand that they can’t get away with providing nothing, or even the bare minimum,” Lee said. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 18: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022 ... [+] in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Los Angeles Times via Getty Images As a result, there are fewer disagreements in investment tax credit transfer negotiations over the scope of due diligence because it’s generally accepted what buyers and sellers need to be confident about the transaction, he said. Debate is more likely regarding due diligence for newer credits that have fewer precedent transactions, such as the section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit. A handful of areas remain where buyers and sellers don’t always see eye to eye. Buyers sometimes ask for an independent engineer’s report. Sellers tend to argue that those reports are unnecessary for transfers, because the purchase takes place after the credits have accrued, Burton explained. Some buyers also seek corporate enforceability opinions. In addition, tax opinions are not part of every deal. Burton said that over half of his firm’s transfer deals through mid-October had no tax opinion condition precedent. The market appears to consider a good indemnity agreement a sufficient precaution. The Required Minimum Is Not Enough The final transfer regulations (T.D. 9993) outline the required minimum documentation that an eligible taxpayer must provide to a transferee, and some sellers initially sought to provide transferees with only that minimum. Advisers quickly pointed out that “minimum” was not equivalent to “recommended.” The preamble to the final rules notes: In providing for the required minimum documentation that an eligible taxpayer must provide to a transferee taxpayer, the intention was to require a baseline of information that is necessary for validating an eligible taxpayer’s claim of eligibility to an eligible credit, while not overburdening the eligible taxpayer with production requirements or altering the arm’s length arrangement between the parties. But the preamble also explains that an objective of the rules was to allow “sufficient flexibility for market participants to determine if more information is necessary in a particular transaction,” and it suggests that agreements between taxpayers might go beyond the minimum requirements. The final transfer regs also include in reg. section 1.6418-5(a)(4) a list of circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause for avoiding an excessive credit transfer tax. Those include review of the seller’s records regarding the determination of the eligible credit, reasonable reliance on third-party expert reports, reasonable reliance on representations from the seller, and review of audited financial statements. The list also helped to frame the standard scope of diligence. Standard diligence for ITC transfers includes the cost segregation report, placed in service substantiation, appropriate insurance coverage, seller credit analysis, prevailing wage compliance, and basic parameters indicating that the project has the right and ability to operate. The validity of any bonus credits must also be covered. If there is a step-up transaction, an appraisal is needed, Lee said. “Our due diligence effort is comprehensive, but efficient — we try to hit all the points that are salient to make sure that credit buyers have everything they need to get comfortable and defend their position if there is a challenge down the line,” he said. Looking Ahead to Audits Planning ahead for an audit means anticipating the questions that the IRS will ask on information document requests and collecting that information in advance. “Typically the purchasers want to do enough diligence that they feel comfortable that even if there is an audit, there’s a complete and substantive file they can point to,” Lee said. Buyers typically also agree with the seller stating that the seller can be involved and allowed to participate in an audit, Lee said. Similarly, if there’s indemnity, the seller is given the right to consent to any settlements, and where insurance policies exist the buyer also provides the insurer with audit participation and settlement consent rights. “An audit is going to be a collaborative exercise,” particularly because there is not typically a way to allow the buyer to transfer an audit to the seller,” Lee said. One way to reduce the risks that worry buyers and insurers is for sellers to show that they have a strong program for ongoing compliance or reporting, Chaturvedi said. “For alterations and repairs, the project developer needs to continue to pay prevailing wages and also give confidence to their insurer or credit buyer that those compliance rules are being met,” he said.

S&P 500 set to grind higher toward 6,000 milestone: Survey Read full article Alexandra Semenova Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 1:00 AM 4 min read Link Copied 4 In this article: (Bloomberg) — This year’s furious rally in US stocks is poised to extend into the final stretch of 2024, even as the US presidential election looms as a major wild card, according to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says The S&P 500 Index ( ^GSPC ) will approach 6,000 by year-end — a record milestone 2.3% above Friday’s close — based on the median estimate from 411 questionnaire participants. Three quarters of respondents expect this earnings season to give the benchmark a boost, and the strength of Corporate America’s results are seen as more crucial for the stock market’s performance than who wins the November vote or even the Federal Reserve’s policy path. US stocks face a big earnings hurdle this week, with roughly 20% of S&P 500 members scheduled to release results, including heavyweights Tesla Inc ( TSLA ). and IBM ( IBM ). About 70 companies in the gauge have reported already, with 76% announcing earnings that surpassed estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. After Tesla, the other so-called Magnificent Seven members report starting later this month. Those technology behemoths — Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ), Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ), Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) and Meta Platforms Inc. ( META ) — have driven the brunt of the equities advance since last year. But they trailed last quarter as the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2020, supporting sectors like financials and utilities. Survey takers anticipate the tech giants will take the lead again. A combined 75% expect the Magnificent Seven to either beat or perform in line with the rest of the market this quarter, after the group started October with a 0.9% decline. One reason investors remain bullish is that the bulk of the S&P 500’s earnings growth still comes from the Magnificent Seven. “The catch-up in the Magnificent Seven after a lackluster quarter is a compelling trade to look at right now,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. The median survey respondent sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5,977, up from Friday’s close of about 5,865. That would extend the index’s 23% gain in 2024, which has taken it to 47 record closing highs, including two last week. Story continues The historical median of S&P 500 returns from mid-October to Dec. 31 is roughly 5%, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk going back to 1928. It’s even higher in election years, at about 7%. Earnings First Optimism around US equities from survey-takers comes as the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is coming down to the wire, with polling showing the candidates largely neck and neck. There’s been chatter lately about a supposed revival in trades that are expected to benefit from a victory by Trump, the Republican candidate, including in Bitcoin and shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. However, the biggest chunk of respondents — 45% — said the strength of earnings matters most for their equity portfolios, compared with 39% pointing to the election outcome and 16% for the magnitude of Fed easing. “I know the election brings a lot of emotion depending on whether one’s candidate wins or not, but don’t let that come into your portfolio,” said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at wealth advisory firm Halbert Hargrove. One event that tech-stock watchers will be focusing on is Nvidia’s earnings, to be released in November. The company’s last report drove the chipmaker’s shares down in the following days. This time around, the biggest group of survey respondents, 45%, see the results pushing the stock up. Nvidia has been the poster child for the boom in AI technology, with its stock almost tripling this year. While poll-takers show plenty of enthusiasm around tech, there’s another area that they anticipate will lead the S&P 500 this quarter: financials. That result is playing out so far. The sector is up 5% in October, the most among the 11 S&P 500 groups, buoyed by strong earnings from Wall Street. Bank stocks tend to do well when the Fed cuts rates, which stands to boost borrowing and other economic activity. The MLIV Pulse survey was conducted Oct. 14-18 among Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey, and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors.

Acesian Partners Limited's (Catalist:5FW) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 2:28 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 Most readers would already know that Acesian Partners' (Catalist:5FW) stock increased by 2.4% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Acesian Partners' ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Acesian Partners How To Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Acesian Partners is: 28% = S$6.5m ÷ S$24m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every SGD1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated SGD0.28 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. Acesian Partners' Earnings Growth And 28% ROE First thing first, we like that Acesian Partners has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.0% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Acesian Partners' considerable five year net income growth of 60% was to be expected. As a next step, we compared Acesian Partners' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Acesian Partners is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Story continues Is Acesian Partners Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Given that Acesian Partners doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business. Summary On the whole, we feel that Acesian Partners' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Not to forget, share price outcomes are also dependent on the potential risks a company may face. So it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved in the business.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , YouTube , and Bloomberg . All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here . ~~~ 00:00:09 [Speaker Changed] This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio. 00:00:15 [Speaker Changed] I’m Barry Ritholtz, you are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio this week on the podcast, what can I say? Brian Higgins has put together a amazing track record handling distressed and stressed debts, as well as other forms of credit real estate collateralized obligations. King Street is a fascinating firm. It was formed in 1995. Over the course of the past, I don’t know, 25 years, they’ve put together really an impressive track record. They have already returned about 80% of the net gains they’ve had to their, their limited partners. Really, there are a few people in the world who have a better sense of distress, asset credit, real estate, and how to not only do the fundamental research, but tactically trade around the positions. As an example, institutional investors mentioned King Street in 2022, perhaps the worst year for hedge funds since oh 8 0 9. They were down 3.8%. Their benchmarks were down. You know, fixed income was 15%, equities was 20 something percent. To to be low single digits is really just a, a testament to their performance. There are a few people who are more knowledgeable about fixed income credit real estate and distressed investing than, than Brian. Hi Higgins. I found this conversation to be fascinating and I think you will also, with no further ado, king Streets, Brian Higgins. 00:01:58 [Speaker Changed] Well, thank you very much, Barry. I appreciate you having me. 00:02:00 [Speaker Changed] I appreciate you being here. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation for a while. Let, let’s jump right into it. You get a bachelor’s in, in business administration from Villanova University. What was investing always the career plan? 00:02:13 [Speaker Changed] Well, actually I started out electrical engineering. 00:02:16 [Speaker Changed] Me too. That’s funny you say that. First, 00:02:18 [Speaker Changed] First two years, electrical engineering. You graduated from high school. I’m good at math and science and you know, I always had an idea what go into business, but I felt that electrical engineering would be a good foundation. And, and that’s what I started at. But after two years it was sort of not very interesting. And I was intrigued by the markets at the time, in the mid eighties, you had a lot of stuff going on in terms of the merger boom. And Wall Street was rocking and I said, Hey, this is sort of interesting. I was probably the only electrical engineering major that had a subscription to the Wall Street Journal. Right. So my, my roommate, who was a mechanical engineer, said to me, what are you doing? Why don’t you just switch over to finance? Which I, I said Sure. 00:03:01 [Speaker Changed] Makes, makes a lot of sense. So you come out of Villanova, you end up at first Boston in, in 1987 in the Special Situations Fund and Distressed Securities Group. 00:03:11 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, we started out, I started on banking, the two year banking program, which merchant banking was the group I was in. My co-founder was an analyst. He came into Yale. He was in the bankruptcy advisory group. So we’re in the analyst program together, 65 of us. And after two years, I went down to Trade Distress Proprietary. I got promoted to associate with without going business school. I had done undergraduate business and felt that, you know, hey, I can do this and I, but I wanna get something different, just rather being, the analyst had never left. I wanna get some markets experience, but, you know, stay in the proprietary side. So they, there was a proprietary trading group that was forming, and I, I was joined that and it was a interesting time in, in high yield as you know, shortly thereafter, Drexel, which goes from one day issuing commercial paper, and the next day they go bankrupt. Right. 00:04:04 [Speaker Changed] So, so what was it like trading distress securities in in the late eighties that had to be, you know, a pretty, let’s call it target rich environment? Well, 00:04:13 [Speaker Changed] I would say it was interesting because the market sophistication that we have today in terms of really the fluidity of capital structures of trading desks, et cetera, the seamlessness, which you had, you had, it was interesting. You’d see things go from, say the investment grade market to the high yield market. There was a big disconnect as they move positions that started to trade wider. The buyers didn’t have the ability to go cross assets and cross, let’s say, ratings as, as they are today. You know, mutual funds were very siloed and, and now they’re, they’re a bit wider mandates. So it was, yes, you had, you know, NAIC ratings changed for your insurance companies post Drexel. And so there was a number of less liquid markets that made for quite wide spreads. You had a default cycle, so you had trading with accrued and trading flat. And so there was certainly a number of different movements, but there was certainly downside of these things. So one had to be very rigorous in your investing, in your, in your analysis to do the investing. So 00:05:24 [Speaker Changed] You’re at a big bank in, in 87, you know, obviously there were a lot of market dislocations later that year. What was that experience like for you? 00:05:33 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was interesting. I mean, it certainly was a indoctrination into the world of finance. You go from, you know, these big parties during the summer as you welcome to the new analysts to the market crash, obviously in October of 87. I, I think the, the volatility that ensued and then, you know, the world’s gonna end and then, you know, it, it, it comes back. I I think that just spoke to the resiliency of markets, but also the, certainly the volatility and fragility of certain sectors that one has to be mindful of. And you know, I think ultimately there was a number of opportunities that came out. I had no money back in 87, but certainly, you know, some of the managing directors and other people that had some money, they, they made quite a, quite a bit of of profits on, on some of the left for dead Microsoft and others that were just, you know, sold to very low levels as 00:06:28 [Speaker Changed] Opposed. So, so that sort of dislocation sounds like it was a formative experience. 00:06:33 [Speaker Changed] Sure. And you know, many of these things I look at, you know, growing up, you know, gas lines in the seventies and, you know, we had real recessions back in the seventies and eighties, right. These days, you know, it sound like an old cranky old guy. But when you, you know, that’s the challenge of prosperity that it, it doesn’t really prepare oneself. Investors too. Right. You know, if you always have the, the Fed put, if you always have, you know, just QE forever, that, that does have a lot of complacency. And you see it as you’ve gone from active to passive investing, people are like, well, why do I pay, you know, for active investing, I could just, you know, it, it’s easy. And now as dispersion has increased in fixed income, I think it’s brings back, you know, the act of investing. But, you know, structurally there’s, there’s a lot of money that’s gone into to pass investing, which we believe will sow the seeds for the opportunity set for some time going forward. And, and 00:07:30 [Speaker Changed] Arguably passive doesn’t work nearly as well on the fixed income side as it does on equities. 00:07:35 [Speaker Changed] Well, I mean, again, passive, you know, it’s, nowadays if you look at the big banks, they’re doing portfolio trading with large swaths of, of their institutional clients. And so some will say, I want gimme a triple B single A exposure and these industries, and they go out and dial it up or down in terms of exposure that creates opportunities within the trading market. So for our long short credit hedge fund, you know, there’s, there’s dislocations and opportunities to trade to make money in, in, in those situations. But I mean, you know, it’s in, in these, these markets as we, as we pivot going forward, again, if, if you’re saying, I’m gonna earn five and change percent, you know, my cash and, you know, fixed income, no problem. Default rates are near zero now, fault rates are, are kind of skewed a bit because you, you do have perhaps in high yield, if you look at, you know, with these liability management exercises and other restructurings outta court, it doesn’t default. But then there’s a, a lesser consideration you get for your, your claim. So it does factor into it. But you know, you’ve had a very benign default environment as we’ve had a lot of money printed for quite some time. If you look at the Fed’s balance sheet, the M two that has been printed, you know, there’s, there’s been a great tailwind. 00:09:00 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really interesting. So let’s fast forward to 1995. What led you guys to depart and co-found King Street? 00:09:09 [Speaker Changed] So going from, you know, first Boston Banking, trading distress proprietary, then we started internal hedge fund at first Boston, and that was from 91 to 94. So if you think about, I already had started in effect helped form to these businesses. And so at the end of 94, again, many issues with first Boston, which became Credit Suisse, which became UBS. They’ve, I think I had five CEOs I worked under for, for the seven, eight years I was there. And so we said we could do this. And my co-founder and myself, we, we left around a few months apart and in 94 formed King Street started trading in 95. We never thought we’d start with the princely sum of $4 million, which is what we started with. We, we, we thought, oh, we’re gonna start with 50. All these people are like, yeah, I’ll give you five, I’ll give you 10, you know, no problem in encouraging us to leave. 00:10:02 So be it. We started with four. One of the, the first million dollars came from Jimmy Kane who was chairman at Bear. Yeah, yeah. Chairman, CEO of Bear Stearns. I had met him through another friend of mine, Vince tsi, and known him through golf and, and got to be friendly with him. And he, he heard what I was doing and he said, you know, I’m happy to give you a million dollars of my money to manage and you can use my name in marketing. Wow. And so, you know, it was, it was quite comical because, you know, I have back then a list of references, right. It felt like I was going for a job interview asking for money back then. And we were two guys, 29 years old as you know, my brother called us two guys capital and we would, you know, go around to all the usual suspects begging for something. 00:10:47 And we ended up, as I said, with 4 million. But, you know, Jimmy took a personal pride and he took, he, and people would say, you mean I can call this guy he’s CEO Bear Stearns. And I said, yeah, yeah, call him up. So he’d call him up and then immediately he’d call me up, he said, you know, how did I do you get the money yet? So, you know, it was, it was, it was very humbling. It was a, a very sweet, you know, mentor of mine as, as a Irish Catholic kid. You know, it was nice to have a rabbi such as, such as Jimmy and, and Vince, you know, introduced us. And also Vince was incredibly helpful. So having two, you know, fathers of, of King Street, if you will. And they asked for nothing in return except the satisfaction that they received by seeing us grow and prosper, which was again, very, very fortunate and, and blessed to have that, those two people in my life. 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] So, so from $4 million, you eventually grow assets over time to 26 20 $7 billion. That, that’s an incredible track record over 25 years. And I also can’t help but notice it’s been reported by places like institutional investor that you guys have distributed about 80% of those gains, which is really impressive. It tells me that you’re concerned about scaling up too large. Tell us a little bit about why you kept the firm at a fairly modest size in terms of, of capital that you’re trading. 00:12:15 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think there’s opportunities that ebb and flow and I think it’s important to have the right structure. And so we have a number of business lines. We have our cloudize loan obligation business, CLO business that is, is super interesting business. It does help feed into our long short credit business, which is our longstanding business that we started in 1995. We also have number, the drawdown businesses draw down, meaning draw down credit distress businesses. And those have longer duration attached to ’em, which is commensurate with the opportunities we’re investing in. We also have a real estate business that we, so it used to be the credit hedge fund business had what’s called side pockets a couple years ago we removed them and it just, the liquid long short credit business and the side pockets come into form, form of these draw down fund structures. That is something the industry has gravitated towards the last say 10 years. And so 00:13:11 [Speaker Changed] Meaning as each of those things mature, they get paid out to the correct, 00:13:15 [Speaker Changed] Right 00:13:15 [Speaker Changed] To the LPs. Right? 00:13:16 [Speaker Changed] So you got three or three year, one year extension perhaps, which three year investing through harvesting and then payout traditional, but they can vary. And so that’s really having different buckets and one has to, you know,

S&P 500 set to grind higher toward 6,000 milestone: Survey Read full article Alexandra Semenova Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 1:00 AM 4 min read Link Copied 4 In this article: (Bloomberg) — This year’s furious rally in US stocks is poised to extend into the final stretch of 2024, even as the US presidential election looms as a major wild card, according to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says The S&P 500 Index ( ^GSPC ) will approach 6,000 by year-end — a record milestone 2.3% above Friday’s close — based on the median estimate from 411 questionnaire participants. Three quarters of respondents expect this earnings season to give the benchmark a boost, and the strength of Corporate America’s results are seen as more crucial for the stock market’s performance than who wins the November vote or even the Federal Reserve’s policy path. US stocks face a big earnings hurdle this week, with roughly 20% of S&P 500 members scheduled to release results, including heavyweights Tesla Inc ( TSLA ). and IBM ( IBM ). About 70 companies in the gauge have reported already, with 76% announcing earnings that surpassed estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. After Tesla, the other so-called Magnificent Seven members report starting later this month. Those technology behemoths — Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ), Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ), Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) and Meta Platforms Inc. ( META ) — have driven the brunt of the equities advance since last year. But they trailed last quarter as the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2020, supporting sectors like financials and utilities. Survey takers anticipate the tech giants will take the lead again. A combined 75% expect the Magnificent Seven to either beat or perform in line with the rest of the market this quarter, after the group started October with a 0.9% decline. One reason investors remain bullish is that the bulk of the S&P 500’s earnings growth still comes from the Magnificent Seven. “The catch-up in the Magnificent Seven after a lackluster quarter is a compelling trade to look at right now,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. The median survey respondent sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5,977, up from Friday’s close of about 5,865. That would extend the index’s 23% gain in 2024, which has taken it to 47 record closing highs, including two last week. Story continues The historical median of S&P 500 returns from mid-October to Dec. 31 is roughly 5%, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk going back to 1928. It’s even higher in election years, at about 7%. Earnings First Optimism around US equities from survey-takers comes as the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is coming down to the wire, with polling showing the candidates largely neck and neck. There’s been chatter lately about a supposed revival in trades that are expected to benefit from a victory by Trump, the Republican candidate, including in Bitcoin and shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. However, the biggest chunk of respondents — 45% — said the strength of earnings matters most for their equity portfolios, compared with 39% pointing to the election outcome and 16% for the magnitude of Fed easing. “I know the election brings a lot of emotion depending on whether one’s candidate wins or not, but don’t let that come into your portfolio,” said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at wealth advisory firm Halbert Hargrove. One event that tech-stock watchers will be focusing on is Nvidia’s earnings, to be released in November. The company’s last report drove the chipmaker’s shares down in the following days. This time around, the biggest group of survey respondents, 45%, see the results pushing the stock up. Nvidia has been the poster child for the boom in AI technology, with its stock almost tripling this year. While poll-takers show plenty of enthusiasm around tech, there’s another area that they anticipate will lead the S&P 500 this quarter: financials. That result is playing out so far. The sector is up 5% in October, the most among the 11 S&P 500 groups, buoyed by strong earnings from Wall Street. Bank stocks tend to do well when the Fed cuts rates, which stands to boost borrowing and other economic activity. The MLIV Pulse survey was conducted Oct. 14-18 among Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey, and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors.

Acesian Partners Limited's (Catalist:5FW) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 2:28 AM 3 min read Link Copied 0 Most readers would already know that Acesian Partners' (Catalist:5FW) stock increased by 2.4% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Acesian Partners' ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Acesian Partners How To Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Acesian Partners is: 28% = S$6.5m ÷ S$24m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every SGD1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated SGD0.28 in profit. What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. Acesian Partners' Earnings Growth And 28% ROE First thing first, we like that Acesian Partners has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.0% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Acesian Partners' considerable five year net income growth of 60% was to be expected. As a next step, we compared Acesian Partners' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%. past-earnings-growth Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Acesian Partners is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E , relative to its industry. Story continues Is Acesian Partners Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? Given that Acesian Partners doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business. Summary On the whole, we feel that Acesian Partners' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Not to forget, share price outcomes are also dependent on the potential risks a company may face. So it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved in the business.

OpenSys (M) Berhad's (KLSE:OPENSYS) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financial Prospects Look Decent: Is The Market Wrong? Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 4:10 AM 4 min read Link Copied 0 It is hard to get excited after looking at OpenSys (M) Berhad's (KLSE:OPENSYS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 9.9% over the past three months. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on OpenSys (M) Berhad's ROE. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for OpenSys (M) Berhad How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for OpenSys (M) Berhad is: 14% = RM13m ÷ RM90m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every MYR1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn MYR0.14 in profit. Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth? So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. OpenSys (M) Berhad's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE At first glance, OpenSys (M) Berhad seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Despite this, OpenSys (M) Berhad's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 3.5%. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures. We then compared OpenSys (M) Berhad's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 12% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OpenSys (M) Berhad fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide. Story continues Is OpenSys (M) Berhad Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? With a high three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%), most of OpenSys (M) Berhad's profits are being paid to shareholders. This definitely contributes to the low earnings growth seen by the company. In addition, OpenSys (M) Berhad has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Summary Overall, we feel that OpenSys (M) Berhad certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, while the company does have a high ROE, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing. This can be blamed on the fact that it reinvests only a small portion of its profits and pays out the rest as dividends. While we won't completely dismiss the company, what we would do, is try to ascertain how risky the business is to make a more informed decision around the company.

(Photo: REUTERS/Tingshu Wang) 21 Oct 2024 09:44AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SHANGHAI: More than 20 Chinese listed companies have announced plans to tap special central bank lending for share purchases, according to exchange filings, days after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) kicked off the US$42 billion funding scheme. The PBOC launched the relending programme on Friday, allowing listed companies or their major shareholders to borrow cheaply to fund share buybacks or holding increases. The scheme is worth 300 billion yuan (US$42.24 billion) initially. Companies including oil giant China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec) and port operator China Merchants Port Group said in filings over the weekend that they had secured special loans from banks for share buybacks or purchases. Analysts expect more firms to follow suit, injecting fresh cash into the stock market and adding fuel to a rally that appears to be losing steam. Under the scheme, listed companies and their major shareholders can obtain loans at interest rates of up to 2.25 per cent, which could be enticing for companies with higher dividend ratios or net profit margins, said Wang Mengying, analyst at Nanhua Futures. "If I'm a business owner ... I have incentive to buy back shares if the cost of equity financing is higher than 2.25 per cent," Wang said. Similarly, companies with net profit margins exceeding that level could also be willing to buy back shares, she said, predicting blue-chip companies would be more likely to participate in the scheme. Sinopec said in a statement that its controlling shareholder had signed a contract with Bank of China to obtain 700 million yuan worth of special loans to fund share purchases. In a separate statement, the state oil giant said it had also obtained up to 900 million yuan of loans from the lender for share buybacks. COSCO Shipping Holdings said it had secured loans from Bank of China to buy back 2 billion yuan worth of shares.

Gauge your tolerance for risk Updated - October 21, 2024 at 07:30 AM. Determining risk attitude is difficult. It is best to be mindful that investing in equity is important because having investments only in bonds cannot help achieve your financial goals By Venkatesh Bangaruswamy Comments Share Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove See All Mutual fund advertisements and public awareness programmes seem to suggest you can determine your risk attitude and choose an appropriate mutual fund to invest to achieve your goals. In this article, we discuss why determining your risk tolerance is not easy. Risk vs Loss Risk is the possibility of loss in the future. To determine risk tolerance, you must be aware as to how much loss you can bear in the future. The issue is our brain is a bad simulator. We cannot easily determine how much of pain we can endure in the future. Often, we overestimate our ability to bear losses. Therefore, we tend to take more risk than we can bear. So, when risk materialises and investments generate losses, we want to bail out. In other words, our tolerance to loss is much lower than our tolerance to risk. You cannot determine your loss tolerance level, unless you document your behaviour when you incur large losses. If it is any consolation, even investment professionals find it difficult to accurately determine loss tolerance levels of clients. Note that regulations in most countries require investment advisers to administer a risk-tolerance questionnaire. There is no-loss tolerance questionnaire. Overestimating risk tolerance But why is that we tend to overestimate risk tolerance? For one, we may be suffering from projection bias. This refers to the common belief that if the stock market has gone up in recent times, it will continue to do so in the future. So, we are willing to brave the market. But when the market declines, loss tolerance kicks in. For another, it could be a simple case of not wanting to give up potential gains. What if you take risk and it pays off? So, the expected happiness from gains could prompt an individual to take risk. But if the risk materialises, the pain of losses set in. Remember, 20 per cent loss can give us more pain than the happiness we may get from 20% per cent gains. Conclusion Determining risk attitude is difficult, leave alone loss-tolerance level. It is best to be mindful that investing in equity is important because having investments only in bonds cannot help achieve your goals. What kind of equity funds to buy and what should be the asset allocation? A simple approach would be to buy an index fund. We will have a discussion on asset allocation soon.

Asia’s benchmark stock index traded in a narrow range early Monday, while gold touched a record high as tensions in the Middle East stoked demand for the asset as a haven. Australian stocks gained, while Japanese equities slipped and Hong Kong equity futures signaled declines. US futures rose after the S&P 500 notched up a sixth straight weekly increase, its longest winning streak this year following a slew of corporate results and signs the world’s largest economy remains robust. Financial markets are being shaped by wagers on the health of the US and Chinese economies on the one hand, and the impact of hostilities in the Middle East and geopolitics on the other. China’s banks are expected to cut their loan prime rates Monday after the central bank lowered its key rates in late September. The expected reduction comes as investors grow skeptical over a fleeting recovery in Chinese stocks following a swath of stimulus measures. “How influential further easing proves to be in China and Hong Kong equities and the yuan is up for debate, as market participants may be feeling a sense of policy easing fatigue,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne.

Hanging over the meeting is the grinding Russia-Ukraine war and a toss-up US presidential election that offers starkly different economic outcomes for the world. Bitcoin flirted with $70,000, a level last seen since June, amid a spurt of demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds.

Traders will also be closely watching the Indonesian rupiah after new President Prabowo Subianto confirmed Sri Mulyani Indrawati will stay on as finance minister, a sign of policy continuity in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. The reappointment of Indrawati in Prabowo’s administration “should be perceived positively by markets in terms of Indonesia’s medium-term fiscal consolidation narrative,” Barclays Plc strategists led by Themistoklis Fiotakis wrote in a note to clients.

Striking workers will vote on Oct. 23 to ratify a tentative agreement on a new contract the company and their union reached at the weekend, including a wage increase of 35% spread over four years. Investors are positioning for the US election in about two weeks as odds tilt toward both Donald Trump winning the White House and Republicans controlling Congress. Traders have already begun ramping up bets on assets which had thrived in the wake of the former president’s 2016 victory, and are now looking to the impact on proposed policies including a lift in trade tariffs.
